Few people inside China, much less outside, had ever heard of Anbang. It got its start only a decade before, in the unassuming Chinese city of Ningbo. Its business: car insurance.</p><p data-para-count="314" data-total-count="826" _translation="但是，以一種非常中國的方式，安邦來自皇室。它的創始人，一個叫吳曉輝的人，還有很多早期的董事會成員，可以吹噓他們有著令人印象深刻的家庭關係。在共產黨統治政治和商業的國家，通過黨的人際關係可以順利走向成功。">But, in a very Chinese way, Anbang came from royalty. Its founder, a man named Wu Xiaohui, and many of its early board members could boast of impressive family connections. In a country where the Communist Party dominates politics and business, personal connections through the party can smooth the way to success.</p><p data-para-count="246" data-total-count="1072" _translation="星期五它的連接與否都崩潰了。中國政府扣押了安邦，稱它違反了規定，並損害了它的支付能力。其前主席吳曉輝現在在上海法院受到刑事指控。">Connections or not, on Friday it all came crashing down. The Chinese government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/business/china-anbang-waldorf-astoria.html">seized</a> Anbang, saying it broke regulations and jeopardized its ability to pay claims.

But he had married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, once China’s top leader and one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history.

But they have grown in volume to the point that many people consider them<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/business/international/murky-investments-pose-china-risk.html"> a potential threat to the stability of the financial system</a>.
