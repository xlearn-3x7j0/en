But not all of them match the popular image of a jihadi, as Helen Nianias discovered when she met a hipsterish young man for coffee in the Kosovan capital, Pristina.</p><p _translation="一個短鬍子，一件黑豌豆大衣和一個困惑的表情在這個智能咖啡館的桌子間擺弄著我。坐下來，他看起來有點尷尬，因為一大杯咖啡上放著一大杯鮮奶油放在他面前。">A man with a short beard, a dark pea coat and a bemused expression weaves towards me between the tables of this smart cafe. Sitting down, he looks slightly embarrassed as a tall glass of coffee topped with a huge quiff of whipped cream is put in front of him. </p><p _translation="這是Albert Iberisha。他31歲，五年前去敘利亞戰鬥。">This is Albert Iberisha. He's 31 years old and five years ago he went to Syria to fight. </p><p _translation="“我知道這很難相信，但它發生了，”阿爾伯特說，他與不同的極端主義團體共度了九天。他表示，他去敘利亞的主要原因是要反對敘利亞總統巴沙爾·阿薩德，他說，他重點突出，重點突出。">"I know it's hard to believe, but it happened," Albert says about his nine days with different extremist groups. Articulate and focused, he says his primary reason for going to Syria was to oppose the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. </p><p _translation="為了誤導電影Withnail和我，艾伯特去“錯誤地”戰鬥，在不舒服和可怕的經歷之間跳躍。在這個短暫而多事的時期，他說al-Nusra Front--一度曾隸屬於基地組織的一個團體 - 在讓他離開之前試圖徵召他。然後，他去了一群同族阿爾巴尼亞人 - 然後才發現他們正試圖加入所謂的伊斯蘭國家，他不想這樣做。  ">To misquote the film Withnail and I, Albert went to fight "by mistake", ricocheting between uncomfortable and frightening experiences. During this brief but eventful period, he says al-Nusra Front - a group once affiliated to al-Qaeda - tried to enlist him, before letting him go. Then he went to stay with a group of fellow ethnic Albanians - before finding out they were trying to join so-called Islamic State, which he didn't want to do.  </p><figure>

He was taught how to take apart, clean and reassemble a Kalashnikov, but maintains that he never fought.

What I never intended to do was become a member of a terrorist group."</p><p _translation="在阿爾伯特童年時期與塞爾維亞交戰兩年的科索沃長大後，為了一件事而拿起武器似乎並不奇怪。他講故事的方式並不激進，但天真 - 在他到達那里之前，艾伯特對敘利亞的了解大部分來自在線視頻。">Having grown up in Kosovo, which was at war with Serbia for two years during Albert's childhood, taking up arms for a cause did not seem such a strange idea. The way he tells the story he was not radical, but naïve - before he got there, Albert's knowledge of Syria was mostly gleaned from online videos.</p><p _translation="“我曾設想過這種對阿薩德的反對意見，他們沒有犯罪背景的人，”他說。用他的話說，他認為“只有善意的人想幫助人民”。">"I had imagined this opposition to Assad didn't have people with criminal backgrounds in the ranks," he says.
