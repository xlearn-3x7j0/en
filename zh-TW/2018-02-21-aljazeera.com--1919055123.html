<p _translation="這些叛逃者中幾乎71％是女性，大多數是20多歲和30多歲。">Almost 71 percent of those defectors are female, most in their 20s and 30s.</p>
<p _translation="去年年底，只有少數人採取了韓國非軍事區最危險的路線&nbsp;，即朝鮮士兵採取的措施。">Only a few take the most dangerous route through the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/korean-demilitarized-zone-life-border-180211075252774.html">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a>&nbsp;that a North Korean soldier<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/north-korean-soldier-defects-dmz-fog-cover-171221061930348.html"> took late last year.</a></p>
<p _translation="大部分朝鮮人經過漫長而昂貴的旅程，因而穿越鴨綠江後進入中國。">Most of the North Koreans defect via the long and expensive journey that takes them into China after crossing the Yalu River.</p>
<p _translation="這次旅程將個人帶到中國南部邊境，越南和老撾，然後抵達泰國。">This journey takes the individuals to China's southern border into Vietnam and Laos before they arrive in Thailand.</p>
<p _translation="他們經常從泰國飛往韓國。據美國和韓國的一個非政府組織北韓的Liberty稱，有些人甚至選擇去美國。">They are often flown into South Korea from Thailand. Some even opt to go to the US, according to Liberty in North Korea, an NGO based in the US and South Korea.</p>
<p _translation="但他們抵達韓國並不意味著結束他們的擔憂和問題。">But their arrival into South Korea does not signal an end to their worries and problems.</p>
<p _translation="在本系列的第一部分，半島電視台向64歲的金英華髮表講話，他於1988年逃離朝鮮，在漢城成立了朝鮮難民人權協會，負責照顧那些繼續抵達並面臨困難的人士。因此被一些人稱為缺陷之父。">In the first part of the series, Al Jazeera speaks to Kim Young Hwa, 64, who fled North Korea in 1988, formed the North Korean Refugees Human Rights Association of Korea in Seoul to look after those who continue to arrive and face difficulties settling in and is hence called by some as the Father of Defectors.</p>

<p _translation="“我於1970年加入朝鮮人民軍，但十年後留下了鐵路安全項目。">"I joined the Korean People's Army in 1970 but left to work on a railroad safety project a decade later.</p>
<p _translation="“1988年，發生了一起事故，我被指責不忠於國家，如果我留下來，我會像其他四名被指責的人一樣在公開場合被槍殺。">"In 1988, there was an accident and I was blamed of not being loyal to the state. If I had stayed, I would've been shot in public just like the four others who were also blamed for the accident.</p>
<p _translation="“所以我在去越南之前就逃到了中國，那時我被槍斃了，我得到了幫助逃跑，但是被警察把我送到看守所再次抓到，每個月只有兩次飛往朝鮮，在中心，我毆打一名食物托盤的官員，並被判處兩年監禁。">"So I fled to China before going to Vietnam where I was caught carrying a gun. I got help in escaping but was caught again by the police who put me in a detention centre. There were only two flights a month to North Korea so while at the centre, I assaulted an officer with a food tray and was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p _translation="“我在那裡度過了將近兩年，然後設法通過襲擊一名進來給我食物的後衛逃脫。">"I spent almost two years there and then managed to escape by attacking a guard who came in to give me food.</p>
<p _translation="“如果你被訓練成像陸軍上尉那樣，你有基本的導航技能，我設法抵達老撾，在那裡我又被抓到並送到一個勞動營，在那裡我花了九個月的時間，只在甘蔗和香蕉。">"If you're trained to be like a captain in the army, you have the basic navigation skills. I managed to arrive in Laos where I was again caught and sent to a labour camp where I spent nine months, surviving only on sugarcane and bananas.</p>
<p _translation="“我設法越過湄公河越過中國並逃入中國，我沒有食物，在途中吃了蛇，然後遇到了一對韓國夫婦，這給了我錢讓我買了一艘船，這就是我到達的方式韓國。">"I managed to escape and entered China by crossing the Mekong River. I had no food and survived by eating snakes on the way. I then met a Korean couple which gave me money that enabled me to buy a boat and that's how I arrived in South Korea.</p>
<p _translation="“但後來我被指控為間諜，再次被監禁，當時我被指控為中國人，並設法逃跑。1998年，我逃到了日本，但因為有人告訴當局我是間諜而被監禁。&nbsp;">"But then I was accused to being a spy and imprisoned again. I was then accused of being Chinese and managed to run away. In 1998, I escaped to Japan but was imprisoned because someone told the authorities I was a spy.&nbsp;</p>

<p _translation="“我病得很重，一直昏倒，幸運的是，有一個民間團體聽到了我的故事，幫助我獲得了釋放，然後我獲得了日本居留權，並於2001年終於回到了韓國。">"I got very ill and kept fainting. Fortunately, there was a civil group that heard my story and helped me get released. I was then given Japanese residency and in 2001, I finally arrived back in South Korea.</p>
<p _translation="“韓國政府不把叛逃者當作人，社會對他們不感興趣。">"The Korean government doesn't treat defectors as people and the society isn't interested in them.</p>
<p _translation="“ 2005年江原道事件發生後，我在韓國成立了朝鮮難民人權協會，&nbsp;在那裡一名女性背叛者在車禍中死亡，她的屍體被放置在冰箱裡20天，沒有舉行葬禮，沒有人想要交易接著就，隨即。">"I founded the <span>North Korean Refugees Human Rights Association of Korea&nbsp;</span>in 2005 after an incident in Gangwon province where a female defector died in a car accident and her body was placed in the refrigerator for 20 days and not given funeral. No one wanted to deal with that.</p>
<p _translation="“統一部為每個叛逃者提供大約20萬韓元（188美元）的殯葬費，但這並不足夠，也是非常不尊重的，因為他們中的很多人沒有家人，如果他們死了，他們就會像木乃伊一樣死去。">"The ministry of unification gives around 200,000 Korean Won ($188) as funeral fee for each defector but that's not adequate and extremely disrespectful because a lot of them don't have a family here. If they die, they'll die as mummies.</p>

<p _translation="“這就是為什麼我決定成立這個組織，它也為年輕的叛逃者或朝鮮人所生的孩子提供了學習空間。"><strong>"</strong>That's why I decided to make this organisation which also provides study space for young defectors or children born to North Koreans.</p>
<p _translation="“我們的團隊向在中國度過難關的叛逃者送錢，送衣服和送藥，中國有很多年輕女性在性行業或作為妻子出售，男性也被當作奴隸，他們會被迫在農場上工作，但不會得到任何錢。">"Our group sends money, clothes and medicine to defectors who are having a difficult time in China. There are a lot of young women in China who are sold in the sex industry or as wives. Men are also treated as slaves and they'll be forced to work on farms but won't be given any money.</p>
<p _translation="“到目前為止，我已經拯救了近6000名叛逃者，媒體稱我為'叛逆者之父'，但這項工作尚未完成。">"I've saved almost 6,000 defectors so far and the media calls me the 'Father of Defectors'. But the job isn't done yet.</p>
<p _translation="“我不知道我的家人在哪裡，我通過人們聽說他們是在我逃離後遇害的，我逃離朝鮮後我沒有和他們說話。">"I don't know where my family is. I heard through people that they were killed after I fled. I didn't speak to them after I fled North Korea.</p>
<p _translation="“很難想像北方的局勢會發生變化，這不是一生中可能發生的事情，但如果金正恩政權倒台，我會把我的武器越過邊界並報復。現在，我認為我不會浪費時間思考可能永遠不會發生的事情。“">"It's really hard to imagine that the situation in the North would change. It's not something that could happen in my lifetime. But if the Kim Jong-un regime was to fall, I would take my weapons across the border and take revenge. But for now, I don't think I will waste my time thinking about something that will probably never happen."</p>
