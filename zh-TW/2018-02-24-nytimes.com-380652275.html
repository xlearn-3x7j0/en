<p data-para-count="272" data-total-count="272" _translation="國防部長吉姆馬蒂斯，或許是特朗普政府最負責任的國家安全官員，可能已經把總統推上了政治生命線，本週提議允許美國軍方的跨性別成員繼續服役。">Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, perhaps the Trump administration’s most responsible national security official, may have thrown the president a political lifeline by proposing this week that transgender members of the United States military be allowed to continue serving.</p><p data-para-count="354" data-total-count="626" _translation="華盛頓郵報報導的這項建議使得特朗普經常談論他如何看待其將領們的建議，這是一個扭轉他先前對跨性別者和潛在新兵的殘酷決定的機會。為了公平，正義和代表美國多元化的軍事力量，他應該抓住它。">The recommendation, reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mattis-expected-to-back-allowing-transgender-troops-to-stay-in-the-military/2018/02/22/6a584d9e-17dc-11e8-b681-2d4d462a1921_story.html?utm_term=.70aa719c3ca3">The Washington Post,</a> would afford Mr. Trump, who has often spoken about how he values the advice of his generals, a chance to reverse <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/donald-trump-transgender-pandering.html">his earlier cruel decision</a> against transgender enlistees and potential recruits. In the interest of fairness, justice and a military that represents American diversity, he should seize it.</p><p data-para-count="212" data-total-count="838" _translation="美國跨性別人士在軍方中獲得平等捍衛自己國家的權利僅一年之後，特朗普在去年7月發布的一系列推文中，總算表示他將放棄他們的服務。">It was only a year after transgender Americans secured the right to defend their nation as equals in the military that Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets last July, summarily said he would banish them from serving.</p><p data-para-count="473" data-total-count="1311" _translation="這位總統以五次推遲的方式躲避越南戰爭，似乎貶低了變性者，因為他們無理地聲稱軍隊“必須專注於決定性的和壓倒性的勝利”，因此不適合參加戰鬥。自那時以來，許多人都為了防禦包括兩名共和黨參議員，亞利桑那州的約翰麥凱恩，以前的戰俘和猶他州的奧林海奇，還有56名退休將軍和海軍上將。">The president, who dodged the Vietnam War with five deferments, seemed to disparage the transgender enlistees as unsuited for battle by gratuitously asserting that the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” Since then, many have rallied to the defense of the transgender troops, including two senior Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, who is a former P.O.W., and Orrin Hatch of Utah, plus a group of 56 retired generals and admirals.</p>
<p data-para-count="372" data-total-count="1683" id="story-continues-1" _translation="去年秋天，參謀長聯席會議主席海軍陸戰隊員約瑟夫·鄧福德將軍告訴參議院軍事委員會，跨性別軍隊已經榮幸地服役。“我相信任何符合身體和心理標準，並且可在全球部署並且目前正在服務的人應該有機會繼續服務，”他說。">Last fall, Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. of the Marines, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that transgender troops have served with honor. “I believe any individual who meets the physical and mental standards and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve,” he said.</p>

<p data-para-count="402" data-total-count="2085" _translation="當然，對於特朗普來說，最終這一切都不會有什麼影響，特朗普對這個少數群體的鎮壓 - 在130萬現役軍人中只有大約2,450個變性部隊 - 迄今為止反映出明顯地迎合倒退將領和右翼狂熱分子，以及對他的前任制定的許多開明政策進行的反諷。">Of course, none of that might matter in the end to Mr. Trump, whose crackdown against this minority group — there are only about 2,450 transgender troops among 1.3 million active-duty members of the military — has so far reflected obvious pandering to regressive generals and right-wing zealots, as well as knee-jerk opposition to many of the enlightened policies that his predecessor put in place.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

<p data-para-count="511" data-total-count="3589" _translation="頂級防務官員對特朗普的禁令做出了緩慢的反應。在提起訴訟提起訴訟之後，兩名聯邦法官去年年底阻止了它的生效，一名法官認為這很可能違憲。她在10月的決定不僅停止了釋放所有跨性別軍隊的計劃，而且還允許當前的跨性別軍隊重新入伍並允許跨性別人員在1月份開始加入軍隊，這是五角大樓已開始實施的一個過程。">Top defense officials responded to Mr. Trump’s ban by slow-walking it. And after lawsuits were filed challenging the move, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/transgender-ban-military.html">two federal judges late last year</a> blocked it from taking effect, with one judge calling it most likely unconstitutional. Her decision, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html">in October</a>, not only halted a plan to discharge all transgender troops, it also allowed current transgender troops to re-enlist and permitted transgender recruits to join the military starting in January, a process the Pentagon has begun to implement.</p><p data-para-count="442" data-total-count="4031" _translation="儘管這些都是積極的跡象，但仍然存在很多不確定性，包括馬蒂斯先生提出的與跨性別人士的待遇以及特朗普是否有能力改變這個問題的方向。現在馬蒂斯先生的建議已經到達白宮，將由特朗普先生作出最終決定。如果他堅持自己的偏見，迫使變性人離開軍隊並回到陰影之下，那將是悲慘的。">While these are positive signs, a lot of uncertainty remains, including what Mr. Mattis proposes to do with transgender recruits and whether Mr. Trump is capable of changing course on this issue. Now that Mr. Mattis’s recommendation has arrived at the White House, it will be up to Mr. Trump to make a final decision. It will be tragic if he clings to his prejudice, forcing transgender people out of the military and back into the shadows.</p>
