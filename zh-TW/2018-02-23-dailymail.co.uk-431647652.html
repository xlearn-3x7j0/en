The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding [no other liquids or solids] for the first six months of life as it provides all the nutrients a baby needs. It reduces their risk of obesity in later childhood, with every month of breastfeeding associated with a four per cent decrease in risk.</p><p _translation="2.飲食均衡健康&nbsp;"><span>2. Eat a balanced and healthy diet&nbsp;</span></p><p _translation="我們都應該根據Eatwell指南的原則，以健康，多樣的飲食為目標，以滿足我們的能量需求。保持平衡很重要。兒童需要定時進餐和健康的零食，以獲得他們所需的所有能量，作為積極的生活方式的一部分。">We should all aim to eat a healthy, varied diet based on the principles of the Eatwell guide, to meet our energy requirements. It is important to get the balance right. Children need regular meals and healthy snacks to get all the energy they need as part of an active lifestyle.</p><div>        <p _translation="母乳喂養，提供較小的膳食部分和充足的睡眠都是幫助您的孩子成為健康體重的方法（文件照片）">Breastfeeding, offering smaller meal portions and getting plenty of sleep are all methods to help your child be a healthy weight (file photo)</p></div><p _translation="3.讓你的孩子保持活躍"><span>3. Keep your children active</span></p><p _translation="英國的兒童現在身體不適合過去幾代人，這對他們未來的健康有影響。目前的研究表明，只有9％的男孩和10％的2至4歲女孩符合他們的活動建議。五歲以下的兒童在一天中至少應活動三小時。">Children in the UK now are less physically fit than past generations which has implications for their future health. Current studies show that only nine per cent of boys and ten per cent of girls aged two to four years of age are meeting their activity recommendations. Children under five years should be active for at least three hours spread across the day.</p><p _translation="與觀看電視節目相比，年輕人花更多時間玩在線社交。統計數據顯示，7至16歲的兒童每天平均在線上花費3小時，每週看電視8小時以上可能會導致肥胖。對於孩子來說，考慮增加適合他們生活方式的活動類型並且可以在當天輕鬆包括這一點很重要。詢問孩子們他們喜歡什麼活動。鼓勵他們追隨自己的興趣，開展有趣的活動。">Young people are spending more time playing and socialising online than watching television programmes. Statistics show that children aged seven to 16 spend an average of three hours a day online, and that watching TV for more than eight hours a week may be a risk for obesity. It is important for children to think about increasing the types of activities that suit their lifestyle and can be easily included in the day. Ask children what activities they enjoy. Encourage them to follow their interests and make activity fun.</p><p _translation="4.首先提供較小的部分"><span>4. Offer smaller portions at first</span></p><p _translation="兒童的胃口會有所不同，重要的是允許兒童在進食時食用食慾。從出生開始，嬰兒能夠調節自己的食慾和能量攝入。他們會吃適量的食物來滿足他們身體的能量需求。鼓勵孩子認識到飢餓的跡象和飽腹的跡象。重要的是不要教孩子們超越他們的豐滿感。">The appetites of children will vary and it is important that children are allowed to eat to appetite at mealtime. From birth infants are able to regulate their own appetite and energy intake. They will eat the right amount of food to meet their body’s energy needs. Encourage children to recognise the signs of hunger and the signs of fullness. It is important not to teach children to over-ride their sense of fullness.</p><p _translation="首先提供較小的部分。如果孩子吃了一切，並要求更多，那麼給予第二次幫助是可以的。請記住，第二個幫助仍應保持營養均衡。提供蔬菜，沙拉或水果的第二次幫助。鼓勵孩子慢慢吃，咀嚼他們的食物，並在兩口之間停下來。也許試著把刀叉放在每一口之間。">Offer smaller portions at first. It is OK to give second helpings if the child has eaten everything and is asking for more. Remember that second helpings should still be nutritionally balanced. Offer second helpings of the vegetables, salad or fruit. Encourage children to eat slowly, chew their food well and pause between mouthfuls. Perhaps try putting the knife and fork down between each mouthful.</p><p _translation="5.考慮你的家族史"><span>5. Take your family history into account</span></p><p _translation="肥胖的原因之一是家庭體重史。父母雙方肥胖的風險增加19.8％，如果父母一方肥胖，風險增加8.4％。對家長來說，主動考慮家庭用餐時間非常重要。這可能是做一些家庭烹飪活動或改變一些簡單的傳統。不要訂購披薩，取一些pitta麵包，加入番茄醬和一些披薩配料。這是關於在家庭事件中圍繞食物安排愛情，而不是專注於孩子，而父母在角落裡吃薯片！">One of the causes of obesity is family weight history. The risk increases when both parents are obese by 19.8 per cent, and 8.4 per cent if one parent is obese. It’s important for the parent to take the initiative and think about family meal times. That might be doing some cooking activities as a family or changing some simple traditions. Instead of ordering a pizza, get some pitta bread, add tomato puree and some pizza toppings. It’s about installing a love around food as a family event, not just focusing on the child whilst the parent eats crisps in the corner!</p><p _translation="6.確保你的孩子有充足的睡眠"><span>6. Ensure your child is getting plenty of sleep</span></p><p _translation="另一個肥胖的危險因素是每晚睡眠時間少於10小時。對於一至三歲的兒童，建議每晚11-12小時。如果一個孩子的睡眠不足，他們可能會在一天中更加昏昏欲睡，這會影響他們的活動，當他們不一定餓時，他們更有可能在高能量食物中吃零食。為了幫助他們更好地睡眠，並讓自己的睡眠更加充滿活力，可以嘗試在一天中的早些時候關閉電視機，並查看睡前例行程序，例如閱讀書籍或玩家庭遊戲。">Another risk factor for obesity is sleeping fewer than ten hours each night. For children aged between one and three, 11-12 hours a night is recommended. If a child isn’t getting enough sleep they’re likely to be more lethargic in the day which can impact on their activity and they will be more likely to snack on high energy foods when not necessarily hungry. To help them sleep better and wake up feeling more energised, try to turn the TV off earlier in the day and look at bedtime routines such as reading a book or playing a game as family.</p><p _translation="7.盡量不要炒你的食物"><span>7. Try not to fry your food</span></p><p _translation="燒烤，煮沸或烘烤食物，而不添加脂肪，而不是煎炸。不要忘了飲料 - 去喝低熱量的飲料，如半脫脂牛奶，當然還有水。確保你避免給他們含糖飲料，如果汁飲料和南瓜。">Grill, boil or bake foods without adding fat, rather than frying. Don’t forget the drinks – go for low-calorie drinks such as semi skimmed milk and of course water. Make sure you avoid giving them sugary drinks such as juice drinks and squashes.</p><p _translation="“重要的是要認識到，在英國的一年中的某些時候，我們可能無法單獨從陽光和飲食中獲得足量的維生素D以防止缺乏。”Edwina說。">‘It is important to recognise that at certain times of the year in the UK, we may not obtain an adequate amount of vitamin D from sunlight and diet alone in order to prevent deficiency’, says Edwina.</p><p _translation="這篇文章最初出現，並已經與Healthista的許可轉載。"><span><span>This article originally appeared on and has been reproduced with the permission of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthista.com/">Healthista</a>.</span></span></p></div></div>
