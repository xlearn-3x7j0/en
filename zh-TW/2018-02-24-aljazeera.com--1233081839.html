<p _translation="“這真是太神奇了，”牧羊人，也是倫道夫郡教育協會主席。她補充說：“人們不停地提供支持，咖啡，甜甜圈等東西。”&nbsp;">"It was amazing," said Shepherd, who is also the president of the Randolph County Education Association. "People were stopping to offer support, coffee, donuts, stuff all day long," she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="“最重要的是，那些不確定的人會停下來問我們，所以我們能夠解釋我們為什麼在這裡，我們在做什麼，以及讓我們到了這個地步。”">"Most importantly, those who weren't sure about was going on stopped and asked us, so we were able to explain why we are here, what we are doing, and what got us to this point."</p>

<p _translation="儘管美國西弗吉尼亞州教師聯合會，西弗吉尼亞州學校服務人員協會和西弗吉尼亞州教育協會歷來爭奪成員和影響力，但他們在減少醫療保險覆蓋面以及將保險費，共付額和免賠額加倍的情況下統一了這些計劃。">While the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, and West Virginia Education Association have historically competed for members and influence, they unified in the face of reduced healthcare coverage and doubling insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.</p>

<p _translation="Stiles說，政府和當地社區的批評者“正試圖讓它看起來像我們貪婪，我們希望這次大幅度提高”。">Critics in the government and local communities, Stiles said, "are trying to make it look like we're being greedy, that we want this big raise".</p>
<p _translation="“但是，我們希望我們的醫療保險得到充分的資金支持，我們希望有良好的覆蓋面，”她告訴半島電視台，不僅僅是教育工作者，而是所有公共僱員。">"But, we want our medical insurance to be fully funded and we want good coverage," she told Al Jazeera, not just for educators but for all public employees.</p>

<p _translation="由於薪金和福利有所下降，教學激勵措施也有所減少，空缺職位數量增加到700多人。">As salaries and benefits have declined, so have teaching incentives, and the number of vacancies has risen to more than 700.</p>
<p _translation="有近2萬名教師受聘於國家。 &nbsp;">There are nearly 20,000 teachers employed by the state. &nbsp;</p>

<p _translation="西弗吉尼亞州州長Jim Justice本週簽署了一項立法，使教師在七月份增加了百分之二的工資。接下來的兩年內將增加1％。然而，該法案減少了以前提出的增加。"><span>West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed legislation this week that gives teachers a two percent pay increase in July. It will be followed by a one percent increase over the next two years. The bill, however, reduces the increase that had been previously proposed.</span></p>
<p _translation="西弗吉尼亞州的公立學校員工也擔心納稅人資助的私立學校學券合法化，以及增加特許學校的數量，這是美國教育部長貝齊迪沃斯政策平台的核心。">West Virginia's public school employees are also concerned about legalising taxpayer-funded private school vouchers and increasing the number of charter schools, policies which have been at the core of US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's policy platform.</p>
<h2 _translation="“值得冒險的風險”">'A risk worth taking'</h2>
<p _translation="雖然老師沒有從1990年起舉行罷工，教師在西弗吉尼亞州的第13級工會在美國合眾國，根據2012年的研究，發現他們是強大的和全面參與國家政治和制定政策。">Though teachers haven't gone on strike since 1990, teachers' unions in West Virginia rank 13th in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html" target="_blank">United States</a>, according to a 2012 study which found that they were formidable and thoroughly engaged state politics and in developing policies.</p>
<p _translation="作為美國勞工運動的發源地，西弗吉尼亞州擁有悠久的工會歷史，組織了煤礦工人，工匠和護士等工人集體討價還價，改善工資，工作條件和醫療保健。">Viewed as the birthplace of the US labour movement, West Virginia has a long history of strong unions that organised workers such as coal miners, craftsmen, and nurses to collectively bargain for improved wages, working conditions, and healthcare.</p>
<p _translation="然而，根據西弗吉尼亞州的法律，公職人員罷工是非法的，教師可能會通過繼續罷工而面臨罰款或監禁。">However, it is illegal under West Virginia law for public employees to go on strike, and teachers risk fines or imprisonment by continuing the walkout.</p>
<p _translation="在討論法律後果的會議上，謝潑德告訴半島電視台，300名組裝的教育工作者的回應是一致的：“我們的孩子更重要”。">At a meeting to discuss legal ramifications, Shepherd told Al Jazeera that the response of the 300 assembled educators was unanimous: "Our kids are more important".</p>
<p _translation="“所以是的，我們面臨這種風險，但這是值得採取的風險，因為我們的孩子和他們的教育對我們非常有價值。”">"So yes, we face that risk, but that's a risk that's worth taking because our kids and their education is so valuable to us."</p>

<p _translation="在2月20日發布的一份聲明中，西弗吉尼亞州學校監督史蒂文潘恩指出公共僱員停止工作的非法性，並鼓勵“教育工作者倡導他們應得的利益，但尋求最可能中斷行動的課程為我們的學生。“">In a statement released on February 20, West Virginia Superintendent of Schools, Steven Paine, noted the illegality of work stoppages by public employees and encouraged " educators to advocate for the benefits they deserve, but to seek courses of action that have the least possible disruption for our students."</p>
<p _translation="雖然教育工作者希望迅速達成協議，但工會每天都在進行。">While educators hope that an agreement will be reached quickly, the unions are taking it day-by-day.</p>
<p _translation="“讓我們一個鍬：這是一次罷工，”Josh Nelson說，他已經在亨廷頓教了三年高中西班牙語和英語。“我們不知道什麼時候會結束。”">"Let's call a spade a spade: It's a strike," said Josh Nelson, who has been teaching high school Spanish and English in Huntington for three years. "We don't know when this will end."</p>
<p _translation="工會可能採取的下一步措施包括：重新開始工作幾天，然後恢復停工，縣進行罷工，或者繼續全州罷工，直到做出改變。">Potential next steps for the unions include returning to work for a few days before resuming the stoppage, having rolling walkouts by county, or continuing the statewide strike until changes are made.</p>
<p _translation="“西弗吉尼亞州的老師很長時間以來一直非常痛苦，”退休教師兼工會成員Cindy Stemple說，他在西弗吉尼亞州的公立學校工作了35年。 &nbsp;">"West Virginia teachers have been terribly, terribly slighted for a long time," said Cindy Stemple, a retired teacher and union member who worked for public schools in West Virginia for 35 years. &nbsp;</p>
