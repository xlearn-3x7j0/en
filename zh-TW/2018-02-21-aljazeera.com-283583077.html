<p _translation="這是一個有風的星期六早上，七歲的父親穿著一件褪色的海軍航海外套，印上黃色的紗籠，走在他溫和的家門外的牲畜中間。">It's a windy Saturday morning and the father of seven, dressed in a faded, navy track jacket and printed yellow sarong, is walking amid the livestock outside his modest home.</p>
<p _translation="Njapaa向他的一個孫子們大聲呼喊，他們整天圍繞著距離肯尼亞首都內羅畢約250公里的一個小村莊Doldol牧羊。">Njapaa shouts to one of his grandchildren, who herds goats and sheep all day around Doldol, a small village about 250km from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</p>
<p _translation="“準備好放牧這些山羊和羊，確保你準時帶回來！” 他看到他的孫子在四處閒逛時大叫。通常情況下，牲畜會早早離開。">"Prepare yourself to herd these goats and sheep! Make sure you bring them back on time!" he shouts upon seeing his grandson was lazing around. Normally, the livestock would have left early.</p>
<p _translation="儘管每天都有他的日常生活，但Njapaa是一個非常苦惱的人。">Despite going about his daily routine, Njapaa is a deeply distressed man.</p>
<p _translation="78歲的肯尼亞大裂谷Yaaku部落的一名成員&nbsp;是仍然可以說該團體的母語Yakunte的七人之一。所有剩餘的Yakunte演講者都超過70歲。&nbsp;"><span>A member of the Yaaku tribe of Kenya's Rift Valley,&nbsp;</span>the 78-year-old&nbsp;is one of seven people who can still speak the group's native language, Yakunte. All the remaining Yakunte speakers are over the age of 70.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p _translation="“看到那些應該從我們手中接管的年輕人決定放棄這種美麗的語言令人不安，”Njapaa說，咀嚼khat，一種開花植物和許多東非洲人咀嚼的溫和麻醉劑。">"It's disturbing to see that young people who are supposed to take over from us have decided to abandon this beautiful language," said Njapaa, chewing khat, a flowering plant and mild narcotic chewed by many East Africans.</p>
<p _translation="“我們要去哪裡？”">"Where are we heading?"</p>
<h2 _translation="同化歷史">History of assimilation</h2>
<p _translation="在一個多世紀以前，這個名字代表了狩獵人，從埃塞俄比亞遷徙到肯尼亞裂谷的穆科戈多森林的山洞和丘陵。">The Yaaku, a name which translates to the hunting people, migrated from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html">Ethiopia</a> to the caves and hills of the Mukogodo forest in Kenya's Rift Valley more than a century ago.</p>
<p _translation="在那裡，他們開始狩獵並養蜂; 蜂蜜是他們飲食中的主食。">There, they began to hunt and keep bees; honey is the staple food in their diet.</p>
<p _translation="上個世紀初，肯尼亞武士部落和東非最大的牧區之一的馬賽人正在尋找白人定居者佔領土地之後定居的地方。">At the beginning of the last century, the Maasai, a Kenyan warrior tribe and one of the largest pastoral communities in East Africa, were looking for places to settle after white settlers took their land.</p>
<p _translation="他們選擇在穆科果多森林中重新安置，並與他們開始交易的雅庫一起生活。">They chose to resettle in the Mukogodo forest and lived alongside the Yaaku, with whom they began trading.</p>
<p _translation="但由於雅庫的人口少，財富少，馬賽人認為他們的新鄰居不如他們，稱他們為“無牲口的窮人”。">But due to the Yaaku's small population and lesser wealth, the Maasai saw their new neighbours as inferior, calling them Ntorobo, meaning "poor people with no livestock".</p>
<p _translation="老人Njapaa說，他出生時在他村里約有20個Yaaku人。&nbsp;">Njapaa, the old man, said there were about 20 Yaaku people in his village when he was born.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="雅庫開始融入馬賽社區，並隨後採用馬賽所講的馬語&nbsp;來緩解交流。">The Yaaku began assimilating into the Maasai community and subsequently adopted the Maa language spoken by the Maasai<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to ease communication.</p>
<p _translation="“那是當我們的語言開始慢慢減少時，”Njapaa說。">"That's when our language started dwindling slowly," Njapaa said.</p>
<p _translation="今天在肯尼亞僅有約4000人參加活動，雅庫被肯尼亞政府視為馬賽人的一個小分隊。">Numbering only about 4,000 people in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html">Kenya</a> today, the Yaaku are considered a sub-clan of the Maasai by the Kenyan government.</p>
<p _translation="Njapaa說，自從他們是小孩以來，他試圖教他的孩子Yakunte，但無濟於事。今天，他們都使用馬賽語。">Njapaa said he tried to teach his children Yakunte since they were kids, but to no avail. Today, all of them use the Maasai language.</p>
<p _translation="在年輕一代Yaaku中，這種情況很普遍，他們很少對學習一種幾乎不會說話的語言感興趣，現年34歲的Ngaine Kitarpei說，&nbsp; 他自願努力挽救社區的語言和文化。">That is a common thing among younger generations of Yaaku, who are largely uninterested in learning a language that so few can speak, said Ngaine Kitarpei, 34,&nbsp;<span>who has volunteered in efforts to save the community's language and culture.</span></p>
<p _translation="“許多年輕的雅庫男人和女人問我們，誰會[我們]說話？對他們來說，馬賽語言很容易，他們每天與他溝通，”Kitarpei，三個父親誰不能建立一個句子在Yakunte，告訴鋁半島電視台。"><span>"Many young Yaaku men and women ask us, who would [we] speak to? To them, Maasai language is easy and they communicate with it daily," Kitarpei, a father of three who cannot construct a single sentence in Yakunte, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<h2 _translation="恢復Yakunte？">Reviving Yakunte?</h2>
<p _translation="聯合國教科文組織估計，世界上三分之一的語言來自撒哈拉以南非洲地區。">One-third of the world's languages come from sub-Saharan Africa, UN world heritage group UNESCO estimates.</p>
<p _translation="該組織表示，在接下來的100年內，非洲國家所講的2,000多種語言中有多達10％可能會消失。">The organisation says as much as 10 percent of the over 2,000 languages spoken in the African countries may disappear within the next 100 years.</p>
<p _translation="2010年，教科文組織發布了世界語言面臨危險的報告。雅庫是被列為滅絕的6種肯尼亞語言之一。其他人是Elmolo，Kinare，Kore，Lorkoti和Sogoo。">In 2010, UNESCO released a <a href="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap" target="_blank">report</a> of the world languages in danger. Yaaku is among 6 Kenyan languages listed as extinct. The others are Elmolo, Kinare, Kore, Lorkoti and Sogoo.</p>
<p _translation="當地企圖重振語言的努力已經掙紮起來。">Local attempts to revive the language have struggled to get off the ground.</p>
<p _translation="瑪拿西瑪多阿爾，62歲的Doldol牧師，試圖說服村里的年輕人在長老還活著的時候學習雅庫特。">Manasseh Ole Matunge, a 52-year-old priest in Doldol, has tried to convince young people in the village to learn Yakunte while the elders are still alive.</p>
<p _translation="“如果這些老人死了，那將是這種語言的結束，” 馬丁說&nbsp; ，他是五歲的父親，她的祖母是村里只有兩名在 2010年去世前流利地說這種語言的婦女之一&nbsp;。">"If these old men die, that would be the end of this language," said&nbsp;<span>Matunge, a father of five whose grandmother was one of only two women in the village who spoke the language fluently before her death in&nbsp;</span>2010.</p>
<p _translation="Matunge說：“我們這一代和未來的人會活著知道曾經有一種叫Yakunte的語言。">"Our generation and future ones will live to know that once upon a time there was a language called Yakunte," Matunge said.</p>
<p _translation="2010年，他創辦了一個文化團體，將年輕人和少數流利的Yakunte演講者帶到一起，並出版了一本Yakunte翻譯成斯瓦希里語和馬賽語的小詞典。">In 2010, he started a cultural group to bring young people and the few fluent Yakunte speakers that are left together and published a small dictionary of Yakunte words and phrases translated into Kiswahili and Maasai.</p>
<p _translation="但是他的努力很少出現。">But little has come out of his efforts.</p>
<p _translation="“在這一點上，我們已經做了一切，” Matunge告訴半島電視台。">"At this point, we have done everything," <span>Matunge told Al Jazeera</span>.</p>
<p _translation="“我認為現在是我們接受我們的語言已經死亡並繼續說出我們鄰居的語言的時候了。”">"I think it's high time we accept that our language is dead and continue speaking our neighbour's language."</p>
<p _translation="Maarten Mous是荷蘭萊頓大學的非洲語言學教授，他對雅庫人進行了廣泛的研究，他說社區不可能以原始形式恢復垂死的語言。">Maarten Mous, a professor of African linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has extensively studied the Yaaku people, said it is impossible for the community to revive the dying language in its original form.</p>
<p _translation="他說，更現實的目標是將Yakunte的詞彙加入更廣泛使用的Maasai語言中。">A more realistic goal, he said, would be to incorporate Yakunte words into the more widely used Maasai language.</p>
<p _translation="“繼續說馬賽語，但重新塑造一些話語，帶入你被吞噬語言的舊念，”Mous建議道。">"Continue to speak Maasai but reshape some of the words; bring in your old remembered words from the swallowed language," Mous advised.</p>
<p _translation="然而，隨著世界在2月21日觀看國際母語日，慶祝多語言和語言權利的年度活動，Yakunte演講者如Njapaa已經失去了希望。">However, as the world observes International Mother Language Day on February 21, an annual event that celebrates multilingualism and language rights,&nbsp;Yakunte speakers like Njapaa have lost hope.</p>
<p _translation="&quot;My ancestors must be disappointed in us,&quot; he said.">"My ancestors must be disappointed in us," he said.</p>
<p _translation="&quot;We did not protect our language at all. We chose to speak that of our neighbours and forgot ours.&quot;">"We did not protect our language at all. We chose to speak that of our neighbours and forgot ours."</p>
