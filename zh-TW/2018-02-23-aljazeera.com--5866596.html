<p _translation="一個緊急狀態順序緊隨其後宣布，埃塞俄比亞暴跌進一步陷入政治不確定的狀態。">A <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-state-emergency-months-180217131703045.html" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> order soon followed the announcement, plunging Ethiopia even further into a state of political uncertainty.</p>
<p _translation="在準備取代海勒馬里安成為黨的領導人時，執政的埃塞俄比亞人民革命民主陣線（EPRDF）一直在花時間來確定下一步行動，&nbsp;"><span>As it prepares to replace Hailemariam as the head of the party, t</span>he ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been buying time to figure out its next move,&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="在一個執政聯盟主席歷史上也承擔總理職責的國家，圍繞著誰可以介入海勒瑪里安的問題仍在繼續圍繞著。">In a country where the chairman of the ruling coalition has historically also taken on prime minister duties, questions continue to swirl around who could step in for Hailemariam.</p>
<p _translation="但任何接班人都將面臨艱鉅的任務，任命一位新總理可能不足以滿足埃塞俄比亞人對更大政治改革的要求。">But any successor will have a difficult task ahead, and appointing a new prime minister will likely not be enough to satisfy Ethiopians' demands for greater political reforms.</p>
<p _translation="Addis標準報的主編Tsedale Lemma說：“換崗不是人們想要的。”">"A&nbsp;change of guard is not what the people want," said Tsedale Lemma, editor-in-chief of the Addis Standard newspaper.</p>
<p _translation="她解釋說，相反，埃塞俄比亞人要求國家治理的方式“根本性改變”，這樣才能讓所有的利益受到聆聽和代表。">Instead, Ethiopians are demanding "a fundamental change" in the way the country is governed that would allow all interests to be heard and represented, she explained.</p>
<p _translation="“作為一個國家，這不會有太大的區別，EPRDF是EPRDF，”她說。">"As a country, this is not going to make so much of a difference. EPRDF is EPRDF," she said.</p>
<p _translation="“埃塞俄比亞人民不需要改變警惕，他們需要政府的整體變革 - 一個動態的變化，一個根本性的變化，EPRDF目前的考慮方式。”">"The people of Ethiopia are not requiring a change of guard, they are requiring an overall change of the government - a dynamic change, a fundamental change, [to] the way the EPRDF is considered so far."</p>
<h2 _translation="奧羅莫候選人">Oromo candidates</h2>
<p _translation="作為埃塞俄比亞駐美國的分析家，作家哈森侯賽因說，關於誰能夠取代海爾瑪麗亞姆的決定“非常重要”&nbsp; 。">The decision over who will succeed Hailemariam is "vitally important", said&nbsp;Hassen Hussein,&nbsp;a writer and Ethiopia analyst based in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html" target="_blank">United States</a>.</p>
<p _translation="他說，它“可以從懸崖邊走出一條狹窄的道路，或者把（埃塞俄比亞）引入它”。">He said it "could either [present] a narrow path away from the precipice, or lead [Ethiopia] right into it".</p>
<p _translation="在他的前任Meles Zenawi於2012年去世後上台的Hailemariam&nbsp; 說，他將繼續擔任看守總理，直到替補人選被提名。">Hailemariam, who came to power after&nbsp;<span>the death of his predecessor, Meles Zenawi in 2012, </span>said he will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a replacement is named.</p>
<p _translation="但由於“抗議運動的引擎”一直是該國最大的民族國家組織的邊緣化，奧羅莫，侯賽因說可能會造成毀滅性的影響。">But since "the engine of the protest movement" has been the marginalisation of the country's largest ethno-national group, the Oromo, Hussein said that could have a devastating effect.</p>
<p _translation="“如果安裝另一個[種族]組織的人，我認為人們會將其解釋為'呃，你又去了'。這將是似曾相識，“他告訴半島電視台。">"If somebody from another [ethnic] group is installed, I think people will interpret that as, 'Well, there you go again.' It will be deja vu," he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="&nbsp;自2015年以來，奧羅莫所在地的埃塞俄比亞奧羅米亞地區一直在進行大規模的&nbsp; 反政府抗議活動。">Mass&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-mass-protests-rooted-country-history-180219130441837.html" target="_blank">anti-government protests</a>&nbsp;have been ongoing in Ethiopia's Oromia region, home to the Oromo, since 2015.</p>
<p _translation="奧羅莫佔人口的34％以上，長期以來都抱怨政治和經濟上的排斥。抗議者的中心要求之一是在國家一級提高政治代表性。">The Oromo, who make up more than 34 percent of the population, have long complained about political and economic exclusion. One of the protesters' central demands has been for greater political representation at the national level.</p>
<p _translation="EPRDF由四個政黨組成，主要分為民族陣線：提格拉揚人民解放陣線（TPLF），阿姆哈拉民族民主運動（ANDM），奧羅莫人民民主聯盟（OPDO）和南埃塞俄比亞人民民主運動SEPDM）。"><span>The EPRDF is composed of four political parties, mainly divided along ethnic lines: the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organisation (OPDO) and the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM).</span></p>

<p _translation="正在討論成為總理的最著名的奧羅莫名字是奧羅米亞地區政府的總裁Lemma Megersa和他的副總裁Abiy Ahmed，OPDO的領導人物。">The most prominent Oromo names being discussed to become prime minister are Lemma Megersa, president of the Oromia regional government, and his vice president, Abiy Ahmed, a leading figure in the OPDO.</p>
<p _translation="亞迪斯標準報報導，星期四，81名成員OPDO中央委員會指定艾哈邁德為該黨的新主席，從現在擔任副主席的Megersa接手。">On Thursday, the 81-member OPDO central committee named Ahmed as the new chairman of the party, taking over from Megersa, who will now serve as deputy chairman, the Addis Standard newspaper reported.</p>
<p _translation="此舉被解釋為意味著艾哈邁德將成為該黨的總理候選人。">The move has been interpreted to mean that Ahmed will be the party's candidate for prime minister.</p>
<p _translation="泰倫斯里昂是美國喬治梅森大學衝突分析與解決學院的副教授，他說&nbsp;如果選擇像阿姆哈拉這樣的副總理德梅克梅科寧這樣的人，那麼他可能會“進一步增加燃料，奧羅莫抗議活動“。"><span>Terrence Lyons, an associate professor at the School of Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University in the US, said&nbsp;</span>if someone like Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen, who is Amhara, is chosen instead, that could "add further fuel to the fire of the Oromo protests".</p>
<h2 _translation="分裂的聯盟">A divided coalition</h2>
<p _translation="不過，里昂告訴半島電視台， &nbsp;下任總理的任命是最重要的，因為執政黨內部會發生什麼事情，控制著埃塞俄比亞議會所有547個席位，並自1991年以來一直掌權。"><span><span>Lyons told Al Jazeera the</span>&nbsp;appointment of the next prime minister is most important, however, for what it will say about what is happening inside the ruling party, which controls all 547 seats in Ethiopia's parliament and has been in power since 1991.</span></p>
<p _translation="那一年，EPRDF最初是作為數十年內戰中叛亂集團的集合而推翻的，推翻了一個由Mengistu Haile Mariam領導的政府。">That year, the EPRDF - originally formed as a collection of rebel groups fighting in a decades-long civil war - overthrew a government headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam.</p>
<p _translation="前EPRDF主席兼總理梅萊斯在90年代初的過渡時期負責，並於1995年正式當選為總理。">Meles, the former EPRDF chairman and prime minister, was in charge during a transitional period in the early 1990s, before being formally elected in 1995 as prime minister.</p>
<p _translation="里昂斯說，海勒馬里安是梅勒斯去世後EPRDF的“有用的佔位者”。">Hailemariam&nbsp;was "a useful placeholder" for the EPRDF after Meles's death, Lyons said.</p>

<p _translation="他說，EPRDF實施的政治體制是“非常集中，非常分層次的[並且]決策在高層進行並傳達給基層”。">He said the political system the EPRDF brought into force was "very centralised, very hierarchical [and] decisions were made at the top and communicated down to the grassroots".</p>
<p _translation="但矛盾的是，聯盟還為新組建的地區政府賦予了地方決策權和自治權，這些地區政府再次大體上沿著種族劃分。">But paradoxically, the coalition also granted local decision-making power and autonomy to newly formed regional governments, which were once again largely divided along ethnic lines.</p>
<p _translation="“區域國家控制著法院和大學以及農業和水等廣播電台和局，因此政治生活開始變得分散，”里昂解釋說。">"The regional states controlled courts and universities and radio stations and bureaus of agriculture and water and so forth, and so the political life began to become decentralised," Lyons explained.</p>
<p _translation="“集權與分權（權力）之間的這種矛盾總是存在，它總是會成為一個問題，現在我們正在看到它。”">"This kind of contradiction between centralising and decentralising [power] was always there, it was always going to be a problem, and now we're seeing it."</p>
<h2 _translation="這個過程">The process</h2>
<p _translation="近年來，許多抗議者也抱怨說他們認為聯盟內的提格雷安黨所施加的不成比例的權力。">Many of the protesters have also complained in recent years about what they see as the disproportionate power wielded by the Tigrayan party within the coalition.</p>
<p _translation="TPLF從一開始就統治了執政聯盟 - 梅勒斯曾經領導過TPLF和EPRDF--儘管Tigrayan人僅佔埃塞俄比亞1億多公民的6％。">The TPLF has dominated the ruling coalition from the outset - Meles previously headed both the TPLF and the EPRDF -&nbsp;despite the fact that Tigrayan people constitute only six percent of Ethiopia's more than 100 million citizens.</p>
<p _translation="這兩位總理自1991年掌權以來，Hailemariam和Meles也擔任聯合主席。">Both prime ministers since the party took power in 1991, Hailemariam and Meles, also chaired the coalition.</p>
<p _translation="“任何主持EPRDF的人一直都是總理，”Lemma說。">"Whoever is chairing the EPRDF has traditionally been the prime minister," Lemma said.</p>
<p _translation="“這使得[政治體制]改革幾乎不可能，因為黨和政府是一回事，這實際上是埃塞俄比亞人民所厭倦的，這個模糊的路線。”">"This makes reforming the [political system] nearly impossible because party and government are one and the same and this is really what the Ethiopian people are fed up with, this blurred line."</p>
<p _translation="預計180人的EPRDF理事會將在下週舉行會議，選擇一位新領導人，侯賽因說，那麼領導人將會被議會確認為埃塞俄比亞的下任總理，或者不得不推薦其他人。">The 180-member EPRDF council is expected to meet within the next week to choose a new leader, Hussein said, and that leader would then either be confirmed by parliament as Ethiopia's next prime minister, or have to propose someone else.</p>

<p _translation="EPRDF理事會預計將在3月初舉行會議，以決定是否正式接受海勒馬里安的辭職，該機構執行委員會成員Getachew Reda&nbsp; 最近告訴彭博社。">The EPRDF council is also expected to meet by early March to decide whether to formally accept Hailemariam's resignation, Getachew Reda, a member of the body's executive committee,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-21/ethiopia-s-next-leader-could-come-from-protest-hit-oromia-region" target="_blank">recently told Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p _translation="任何總理候選人都必須是埃塞俄比亞議會的成員。">Any candidate for prime minister must be a member of Ethiopia's parliament.</p>
<p _translation="然而，Getachew告訴彭博社，目前沒有參加議會的候選人，如奧羅莫領導人Megersa，可能會在贏得特別補選後被帶入。">However, Getachew told Bloomberg that a candidate not currently sitting in parliament, like Oromo leader Megersa, could possibly be brought in after winning a special by-election.</p>
