<p _translation="當一位詩人和記者在米蘭遇見五名巴勒斯坦人和敘利亞人，他們在逃離敘利亞戰爭之後通過意大利蘭佩杜薩島進入歐洲時，他們決定幫助他們完成前往瑞典的旅程 - 並希望避免被捕為販運者 - 通過偽造婚禮派對。">When a poet and journalist meet five Palestinians and Syrians in Milan who entered Europe via the Italian island of Lampedusa after fleeing the war in Syria, they decide to help them complete their journey to Sweden - and hopefully avoid getting themselves arrested as traffickers - by faking a wedding party.</p>

<p _translation="電影製片人的觀點&nbsp;"><strong>FILMMAKER'S VIEW&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p _translation="由加布里埃爾德爾格蘭德 &nbsp;">By Gabriele del Grande &nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="那是2013年9月，我剛剛到達阿勒頗，由阿什拉菲亞區的四名活動家主持。黎巴嫩歌手Fairuz的聲音從一台舊電腦的揚聲器中熠熠生輝，窒息了狙擊手從城鎮另一邊槍擊的爆炸聲和子彈的聲音。每次我們試圖看窗外，槍手都瞄準了我們。&nbsp;">It was September 2013 and I had just reached Aleppo, hosted by four activists in the Ashrafiya quarter. The voice of the Lebanese singer, Fairuz, booming from the speakers of an old computer, smothered the sound of bomb explosions and bullets shot from the other side of town by a sniper. The gunman aimed at us each time we tried to look out the windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="前線搬到了我們家。我們很無奈。大聲的音樂是我們唯一的盾牌，幫助我們不聽戰爭，不看死亡。我們曾經唱歌，跳舞，講笑話，取笑對方。我們可以聽到背景中的炸彈被我們的音樂窒息。&nbsp;">The frontline had moved to our house. We were helpless. Loud music was our only shield, helping us not to hear the war and not to see the death. We used to sing, dance, tell jokes and make fun of each other. We could hear the bombs in the background smothered by our music.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我們歇斯底里地笑了起來，為最壞的情況做好準備。然後，一個小男孩敲我們的門。他拿著婚紗。我們驚訝地看著他。他有一個嚴肅的表情，當我們讓他進去時，他去了廚房，拿著一把屠刀回來。他開始把裙子剪成細條。然後，他給我們每個人一條條，告訴我們把它綁在我們頭上並跟著他。">We laughed hysterically, ready for the worst. Then, a young boy knocked on our door. He was holding a wedding dress. We looked at him in astonishment. He had a serious expression and as we let him in, he went to the kitchen and came back holding a butcher's knife. He started to cut the dress into thin strips. Then he gave one strip to each of us and told us to tie it tightly around our heads and follow him.</p>
<p _translation="雖然他不超過12歲，我們也不知道他是誰，但我們決定信任他。因此，當我們的頭被包紮成白色時，我們進入了夜晚。整個地區都沒有電。我們正在穿過黑暗的小巷，沿著牆壁滑動我們的手掌引導我們。我們可以看到天空中的星星和紅色防空燈。">Although he was no older than 12, and we had no idea who he was, we decided to trust him. Thus, with our heads bandaged in white we set out into the night. The entire area had been left without electricity. We were moving through dark alleys, sliding our palms along the walls to guide us. We could see the stars and the red anti-aircraft lights in the sky.</p>
<p _translation="一旦踏上主幹道，我們鼓起勇氣，深吸一口氣跑過去，從不回頭。我們全力以赴將我們的身體推向超出我們頭頂呼嘯的子彈之外。第二天，我明白了：白色是自由敘利亞軍隊狙擊手的信號。意識到一件結婚禮服挽救了我的生活真的讓我微笑。">Once on the main road, we plucked up courage, took a deep breath and ran, without ever looking back. It took us all our strength to push our bodies beyond the sound of bullets whistling above our heads. The next day, I understood: white was the signal for the Free Syrian Army's snipers. Realising that a wedding dress had saved my life really made me smile.</p>
<p _translation="我決定保留那條白色織物。一旦我回到米蘭，我把它放在抽屜裡，還有一些從世界各地收集的旅行紀念品。我幾乎忘了它，直到戰爭再次撞上我的門，另一件婚紗再次拯救了我們。">I decided to keep that strip of white fabric. Once I was back home in Milan I put it in a drawer, together with some other travel souvenirs collected from around the world. I almost forgot about it, until war knocked on my door again and another wedding dress saved us once more.</p>

<p _translation="一切都是偶然發生的，不到一個月後我從敘利亞返回。我和兩個來自大馬士革的親密朋友住在米蘭，Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry和Tareq al-Jabr。我們原計劃在米蘭的火車站見面，當一個三十多歲的男人走近我們時，他們正在尋找一家咖啡館。">Everything happened by chance, no more than a month after my return from Syria. I was with two close friends from Damascus who now live in Milan; Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry and Tareq al-Jabr. We had planned to meet at the train station in Milan and were looking for a cafe when a man in his thirties approached us.</p>
<p _translation="他肩上有一個背包，還有一個新來者的樣子。">He had a backpack on his shoulders and the look of a newcomer.</p>
<p _translation="“你知道下一班去瑞典的火車從哪裡出發？” 他用阿拉伯語問道。我們笑了。沒有火車前往瑞典，所以我們給他一杯咖啡。三個小時後，我們還在坐著，圍著煙灰缸裡充滿空杯和煙頭的桌子說話。">"Do you know where the next train to Sweden leaves from?" he asked in Arabic. We laughed. There were no trains leaving for Sweden, so we offered him a coffee. Three hours later we were still sitting, talking around a table full of empty cups and cigarette ends in the ashtray.</p>
<p _translation="他的名字是阿卜杜拉，他是來自大馬士革耶爾穆克的敘利亞巴勒斯坦人。他在戰爭期間逃離了敘利亞，同時他還是拉塔基亞大學的英國文學學生。他於兩週前於10月11日抵達意大利，並在250人死亡的海難中奇蹟般地倖存下來。我們帶他去了米蘭的一個接待中心。我們把他留在那裡，但他的故事跟著我們回家。">His name was Abdallah and he was a Syrian Palestinian from Yarmouk, in Damascus. He had fled Syria during the war, while he was still an English literature student at the University of Latakya. He had arrived in Italy two weeks earlier, on October 11, and had miraculously survived a shipwreck in which 250 people had died. We took him to a reception centre in Milan. We left him there, but his story followed us home.</p>
<p _translation="這不是第一次。當他們逃離敘利亞戰爭時，我們已經將許多哈立德索利曼納斯里的朋友們歡迎到我們的家中。他們通常呆了幾天，剛好有足夠的時間找到可以將他們走私到瑞典的人，他們已經有了家人，朋友或者只是一個同胞的社區。每次他們離開後很長一段時間，他們關於戰爭的故事都會在我們腦海中產生共鳴，直到我們決定我們必須做些什麼。">It was not the first time. We had welcomed many of Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry's friends into our homes as they fled the war in Syria. They usually stayed a couple of days, just enough time to find someone who could smuggle them to Sweden, where they already had family, friends or just a community of fellow countrymen. Each time, long after they had left, their stories about the war would resonate in our heads, until we decided we had to do something.</p>
<p _translation="當我們在我們的朋友Antonio Augugliaro的房子裡吃晚餐時，這個想法浮出水面，他是一位電影導演和編輯。我們在談論阿卜杜拉的故事，關於在米蘭走私敘利亞難民和邊境管制。然後我突然出來了，“你知道邊防人員永遠不會停下來嗎？婚禮派對！警察永遠不會檢查新娘的文件！”">The idea surfaced while we were having dinner at our friend Antonio Augugliaro's house, who is a film director and editor. We were talking about Abdallah's story, about smuggling Syrian refugees in Milan and border controls. Then I suddenly came out with it; "You know who the border guards would never stop? A wedding party! The police would never check a bride's documents!"</p>

<p _translation="這一切都是從一個笑話開始的，直到幾天之後，安東尼奧奧古斯塔洛打電話給我和哈立德。他告訴我們他已經考慮過了，我們必須這樣做。當我問他在說什麼時，他回答說：“來吧！我正在談論新娘！”&nbsp;">It all started as a joke, until a couple of days later, Antonio Augugliaro called me and Khaled. He told us that he had thought about it and that we had to do it. When I asked him what he was talking about, he replied; "Come on! I'm talking about the bride of course!"&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我簡直不敢相信。我們是否真的要假婚禮派對來避免邊界管制，並讓一群戰爭難民前往瑞典尋求庇護？">I could hardly believe it. Were we actually going to fake a wedding party to avoid border controls and take a group of war refugees to Sweden to seek asylum?</p>
<p _translation="哈利德，安東尼奧和我見了一杯咖啡，直視彼此的眼睛。我們必須了解我們是否真的要這樣做。我們感受到可能永遠改變我們生活的選擇壓力。事實上，幫助這些人離開意大利意味著冒著因密謀協助非法移民而被捕的風險。該罪行判處有期徒刑15年。這是致命的嚴重，但新娘的夢想比我們的任何想法都強。">Khaled, Antonio and I met for a coffee and looked straight into each other's eyes. We had to understand if we were really going to do this. We felt the pressure of a choice that could change our lives forever. In fact, helping these people to leave Italy meant risking arrest for conspiring to assist illegal immigration. The crime carried a prison term of 15 years. It was deadly serious, yet the dream of the bride was stronger than any second thoughts we had.</p>
<p _translation="我親眼看到了戰爭，並記住了2013年10月蘭佩杜薩的死亡事件，我們覺得我們做的是正確的事情。對計劃的堅定信念使我們忘記了我們正在運行的風險。其餘的是腎上腺素。在短短的兩週內，我們組織了一場假婚禮，而且還製作了一部電影，將整個冒險變成紀錄片。">Having seen war with my own eyes, and remembering the deaths off Lampedusa in October 2013, we felt we were doing the right thing. This firm belief in the plan made us forget the risks we were running. Adrenaline did the rest. In just two weeks we organised a fake wedding party, but also a film production to turn the entire adventure into a documentary.</p>
<p _translation="與此同時，我們還關注物流：租用四輛汽車和一輛麵包車，決定行程，在旅途中尋找好客。我們去米蘭逛了一家商店，在那裡我們可以買一件結婚禮服和優雅的衣服，還有一位為我們計劃參與的五名巴勒斯坦人和敘利亞人的髮型師。&nbsp;">In the meantime, we also took care of the logistics: renting four cars and a van, deciding the itinerary, looking for hospitality during our journey. And we scoured Milan for a shop where we could buy a wedding dress and elegant clothes, as well as a hairdresser for the five Palestinians and Syrians that we had involved in our plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我們邀請的第一個人是阿卜杜拉。他將成為新郎。然後，我們與Alaa和他的兒子Manar談過一個兒童說唱歌手，他的音樂贏得了我們的心。最後，艾哈邁德和莫納，一對屬於敘利亞的老對手離開了。至於新娘，我們打電話給我們的巴勒斯坦敘利亞朋友塔斯尼姆，他熱情贊同。然後，我發送了一封絕密電子郵件給10位值得信賴的意大利朋友，他們會在邊境管制事件中幫助這個化裝舞會更可信。">The first person we invited was Abdallah. He was going to be the groom. Then we talked to Alaa and his son Manar, a child rapper who had won our hearts with his music. Finally, Ahmed and Mona, a couple of old opponents belonging to the Syrian left. As for the bride, we called a Palestinian Syrian friend of ours, Tasnim, who agreed with enthusiasm. Then I sent a top secret email to 10 trusted Italian friends who would help make this masquerade more credible in the event of border controls.</p>

<p _translation="離開前一天晚上，當我瀏覽我的衣櫥尋找一件漂亮的襯衫時，我發現了阿勒頗的白色繃帶。我在鏡子前面的前額上試了一下。它仍然適合我。有一刻我充滿了回憶。">The night before leaving, as I browsed through my wardrobe looking for a smart shirt, I found the white bandage from Aleppo. I tried it on my forehead, in front of the mirror. It still suited me. For a moment I was filled with memories.</p>
<p _translation="我看到當時遇難的阿布阿德爾，然後是最近訂婚但仍然帶著他的照相機前往阿勒頗的布甚金和原本應該啟動廣播電台的阿布·穆罕默德，而是最終住院了，用迫擊砲擊傷。">I saw Abu Adel, who had been killed in those days, then Bushkin, who had recently got engaged but was still going around Aleppo with his camera, and Abu Mohammad, who was supposed to start a radio station, and instead ended up in hospital, wounded by a mortar.</p>
<p _translation="然後我睜開眼睛，覺得我們可以做到。婚紗會再次保護我們。我把白色的繃帶折起來放在我的口袋裡，然後離開房子。">Then I opened my eyes and felt we could make it. The wedding dress would protect us again. I folded the white bandage and put it in my pocket before leaving the house.</p>
<p _translation="幾小時後，我遇到了我的旅伴。我們共有23人; 意大利人，巴勒斯坦人和敘利亞人。每個人都穿著適當的婚紗 - 來自地中海兩岸的年輕男女，準備冒險一切，共同證明有時夢想成真，而且希望依然存在。">A few hours later, I met my travel companions. There were 23 of us altogether; Italians, Palestinians and Syrians. Everybody was dressed in proper wedding clothes – young men and women from both shores of the Mediterranean, ready to risk everything, together, to prove that sometimes dreams come true, and that hope still exists.</p>

<p _translation="我們離開的那一天，我們不知道我們的冒險可能會觸及世界各地的許多人。我們一回到米蘭就發現了它，並且我們發起了一場眾籌活動來資助這部紀錄片; 來自37個不同國家的2,617名支持者捐贈了10萬歐元。">The day we left, we had no idea that our adventure could touch so many people around the world. We discovered it as soon as we returned to Milan and we launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the documentary; 2,617 supporters from 37 different countries had donated 100,000 euro.</p>
<p _translation="這是有史以​​來意大利和巴勒斯坦電影史上最大的眾籌活動。得益於他們的支持，我們能夠及時完成後期製作，進入第71屆威尼斯國際電影節。">It was the biggest ever crowdfunding campaign in the history of Italian and Palestinian cinema. Thanks to their support, we were able to finish the post-production in time to enter the 71&nbsp;Venice International Film Festival.</p>
<p _translation="這部電影被選中並獲得三項評委特別獎。一年後，它在意大利獲得了戲劇發行，並在全球許多最大的國際紀錄片節（IDFA，HotDocs和DocEdge等等）中都有發布。它還在全球36個國家放映，在意大利的SKY頻道播放，現在以半島電視台英語播放。">The film was selected and won three special awards of the jury. One year later, it had been given a theatrical release in Italy and was featured in many of the biggest international documentary festivals around the world (IDFA, HotDocs and DocEdge, to name a few). It has also been screened in 36 countries worldwide, broadcasted on Italy's SKY channel, and now on Al Jazeera English.</p>
<p _translation="令人驚訝的是，像我們這樣的一群浪漫主義者的瘋狂想法能夠贏得全球眾多人的心。我們想證明地中海不僅僅是一座公墓，而且它也可以是聯合我們的大海。在新娘的一面就是這樣。&nbsp;">It is amazing how the crazy idea of a bunch of romantics like us could win the hearts of so many people around the world. We wanted to prove that the Mediterranean is not just a cemetery, but that it can also be the sea that unites us. <em>On The Bride's Side</em> does just that.&nbsp;</p>
