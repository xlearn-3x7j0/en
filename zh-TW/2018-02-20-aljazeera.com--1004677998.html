    <div id="body-200771816342556199"><p _translation="委內瑞拉已經正式推出了預售其新的數字貨幣，即石油。&nbsp;">Venezuela has officially launched the pre-sale its new digital currency called the petro.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="“Petro出生，我們將為委內瑞拉的福祉取得全面成功，”總統尼古拉斯馬杜羅周二表示。&nbsp;">"Petro is born and we are going to have a total success for the welfare of Venezuela," President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="隨著委內瑞拉麵臨經濟和政治危機的加深，所謂的加密貨幣的推出。&nbsp;">The launch of the so-called cryptocurrency comes as Venezuela faces both deepening economic and political crises.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="據政府稱，石油是由石油，天然氣，黃金和鑽石支撐的，旨在幫助克服美國和歐盟的製裁。&nbsp;">According to the government, the petro is backed by oil, gas, gold and diamonds, and is meant to help overcome US and EU sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="以下是我們對新貨幣的了解。&nbsp;">Here is what we know about the new currency.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 _translation="什麼是石油貨幣？&nbsp;">What is the petrocurrency?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>The idea for the petro currency came from Hugo Chavez, who had foreseen a "strong currency backed by raw materials", according to the government's whitepaper on the petro.</li>
<li>Announced in December 2017, the petro is intended to supplement Venezuela's bolivar fuerte (VEF) currency and help overcome US sanctions.</li>
<li>Petros will be "pre-mined",&nbsp;meaning the government would produce and control it.</li>
<li>Venezuela has allocated&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/maduro-pitch-oil-backed-cryptocurrency-petro-opec-180206123734343.html">five billion barrels</a>&nbsp;of oil to back its new digital currency, which will be tied to the cost of a barrel of Venezuelan oil.</li>
</ul>
<h2 _translation="你可以在哪裡買到它？">Where can you buy it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initially, the petro will be sold in hard currency and other cryptocurrencies, but not in the country's local bolivar currency.</li>
<li>“The presale and initial offer will be made in hard currencies and in cryptocurrencies," Carlos Vargas, the government cryptocurrency superintendent, told state television in late January.</li>
<li>"It is not going to be done in bolivars at this stage,” he added.&nbsp;</li>
<li>"Our responsibility is to put [the petro] in the best hands and then a secondary market will appear."&nbsp;</li>
<li>Vargas also said that after the initial sale, the petro could be sold in exchange for the bolivar.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 _translation="它要多少錢？&nbsp;">How much does it cost?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p _translation="根據政府的說法，每個石油公司都會得到一桶石油的支持，並以相同的價格出售。 &nbsp;">Each petro will be backed by a barrel of oil and will be sold at the same price, according to the government. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p _translation="在推出之前，政府顧問&nbsp;建議38.4％的Petros應該以60％的折扣在預售私人拍賣中出售。"><span>Prior to the launch, government advisers&nbsp;</span>recommended that 38.4 percent of the petros should be sold in a pre-sale private auction at a discount of 60 percent.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 _translation="你可以用它買什麼？">What can you buy with it?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vargas said that each petro can be exchanged through the virtual exchange houses, "but in addition to that, there will be many merchants providing goods and services where you can go with your Petro or any crypto currency to exchange it for a service".&nbsp;</li>
<li>He added: "In a short future Venezuelans can buy in the bakery with the Petro." &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 _translation="它會幫助委內瑞拉的經濟嗎？&nbsp;">Will it help Venezuela's economy?&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p _translation="按目前的價格（每桶62美元），100米的岩石可能有助於籌集約60億美元。政府認為這可以幫助委內瑞拉支付該國的部分義務。&nbsp;">At current prices ($62 per barrel) 100m petros could help raise around $6bn. The government argues this could help Venezuela pay part of the country's obligations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>Also the Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Trade, Jose Vielma Mora, announced that Venezuela will pay for imports from Brazil using the petro cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>"A group of Brazilian companies have agreed to receive payment for the sale of food to Venezuela, through petro, starting on February 20, when the pre-sale of the cryptocurrency [begins]," Vielma Mora added.</li>
<li><span>Brazil has not publicly commented on the Venezuela's planned use of the petro.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 _translation="反應&nbsp;">Reactions&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>The opposition-controlled National Assembly has opposed the idea of the petro, labelling it as illegal.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The US also warned that buying the petro could violate sanctions against Venezuela, which prohibit the purchase of newly issued Venezuelan debt.</li>
