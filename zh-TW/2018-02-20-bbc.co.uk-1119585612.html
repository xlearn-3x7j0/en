<li>A former Miramax employee describes how, as a young woman - and during what was her first meeting with Weinstein to discuss a further job opportunity - Weinstein requested a massage. When she did not agree, she says he pressured her to remove her clothes so that he could massage her whilst he masturbated himself. Weinstein then pressured her to take a shower with him. </li>
<li>Former employees allege that non-disclosure agreements within The Weinstein Company became widespread and allowed Weinstein to continue to behave badly with impunity. One describes her discomfort at being expected to escort women to Weinstein's hotel room and having to collect a prescription for erectile dysfunction injections.</li>
<li>Other employee accounts revealed that a 'code' existed among assistants where they encouraged one another to avoid Weinstein's advances by wearing big jackets, staying in pairs or groups in his presence and by not sitting next to him on a sofa.</li>
