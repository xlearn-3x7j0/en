But the notification led White House lawyers and aides to believe that they were more problematic than the complexity of his finances and his initial failure to disclose contacts with foreign leaders — the reasons Mr. Kushner’s lawyers have said are holding up the process, the two people said.</p><p data-para-count="462" data-total-count="1209" _translation="臨時許可使他能夠獲得嚴密保護的信息，包括總統每日簡報，特朗普先生每天收到的情報摘要。在總參謀長約翰·凱利出於對白宮工作人員秘書羅伯·波特的長期安全檢查延遲一年的披露作出回應之後，總參謀長約翰·凱利對此發表了全面審查後，這個問題變得更加緊迫，因為配偶濫用指控。">An interim clearance has given him access to closely guarded information, including the presidential daily brief, the intelligence summary Mr. Trump receives every day. The issue took on added urgency after the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, issued a sweeping review of interim clearances in response to the disclosure that the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, had his permanent security clearance delayed for a year because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/us/politics/rob-porter-resigns-abuse-white-house-staff-secretary.html">spousal abuse allegations</a>.</p><p data-para-count="161" data-total-count="1370" _translation="在給白宮工作人員的一份備忘錄中，凱利先生說，他將切斷高層訪問許多未能獲得永久許可的助手。">In a memo to the White House staff, Mr. Kelly said that he would cut off high-level access to many of the aides who had been unable to get a permanent clearance.</p>

In addition to the new policy he announced, which appeared meant to restrict Mr. Kushner’s ability to receive high-level national security information. Mr. Kelly has also tried to restrict Mr. Kushner’s access to the president.</p><p data-para-count="247" data-total-count="2397" _translation="“我會讓凱利將軍做出這個決定，並且他會為國家做正確的事，”特朗普在與澳大利亞首相馬爾科姆特恩布爾的新聞發布會上說。“我毫不懷疑他會做出正確的決定。”">“I will let General Kelly make that decision, and he’s going to do what’s right for the country,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. “I have no doubt he will make the right decision.”</p>

He complained that it had taken “months and months and months” for some of his staff members to be given their security clearances, despite the fact that some of them do not have complicated financial backgrounds — a factor that sometimes delays background investigations.</p><p data-para-count="285" data-total-count="4559" _translation="儘管聯邦安全審查系統一直被批評為破產，並且積壓了數十萬份未決申請，但白宮高級官員幾乎總是將他們的申請加快，以便他們可以在幾週內完成清算並履行職責。">While the federal security clearance system has long been criticized as broken and has a backlog of hundreds of thousands of pending applications, senior White House officials almost always have their applications expedited so they can be cleared within weeks and perform their duties.</p><p data-para-count="180" data-total-count="4739" _translation="多位高級官員非常不尋常地花費了幾個月的時間才獲得臨時許可，這是凱利先生私下在九月開始討論的一個問題。">It is highly unusual for multiple senior officials to spend months serving with only interim clearances, a problem that Mr. Kelly privately began talking about fixing in September.</p><p data-para-count="302" data-total-count="5041" _translation="庫什納先生去年簡要會見了羅伯特米勒三世的調查人員，討論他與前國家安全顧問邁克爾T.弗林的交往。採訪使庫什納先生的律師認為他在特別法律顧問調查中被認為是證人，而不是目標。">Mr. Kushner met with Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators briefly last year to discuss his dealings with the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The interview led Mr. Kushner’s lawyers to believe that he was considered a witness, not a target, in the special counsel investigation.</p>
