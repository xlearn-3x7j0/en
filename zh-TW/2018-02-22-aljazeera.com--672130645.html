<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body-170301071804049"><p _translation="美國傳教士的綽號“上帝的機槍”在世界各地傳播他的基督教傳道者的信息已經死亡99歲。">The US preacher nickname "God’s Machine Gun" who carried his Christian evangelist message around the globe has died aged 99.</p>
<p _translation="一位發言人說，比利·格雷厄姆在講台上70年的時間裡向全世界的總統提供建議並向全世界數以百萬計的人講道。">Billy Graham, who counseled presidents and preached to millions across the world during his 70 years in the pulpit, died on Wednesday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p _translation="根據他的事工，他向歷史上任何其他人宣傳基督教，通過親自或通過電視和衛星線路向成千上萬的人傳播基督教。">According to his ministry, he preached Christianity to more people than anyone else in history, reaching hundreds of millions of people either in person or via TV and satellite links.</p>
<p _translation="“他可能是他那個時代的統治宗教領袖，”威廉馬丁說，“先知榮譽：比利格雷厄姆的故事”的作者。">"He was probably the dominant religious leader of his era," said William Martin, author of "A Prophet With Honor: The Billy Graham Story."</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆的聲譽在與尼克松秘密錄製談話後受到了重創，在這次談話中，傳教士抱怨說，1972年猶太人對美國媒體的影響太大。但他說他不記得談話並道歉。他也不贊同同性戀，但在他職業生涯的晚年，他故意淡化他的政治信仰，專注於福音。">Graham’s reputation took a hit after secretly recorded conversation with Nixon &nbsp;in which the evangelist complained that Jews had too much influence on the US media <span>surfaced in 1972</span>. But &nbsp;said he could not remember the conversation and apologized. He also did not approve of gays but in the later years of his career he intentionally muted his political beliefs to focus on the Gospel.</p>
<p _translation="他還會見了許多世界領導人，並且是第一位著名的福音傳教士，在鐵幕後面傳達他的信息。">He also met with scores of world leaders and was the first noted evangelist to take his message behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p _translation="唐納德特朗普總統在Twitter上說：“偉大的葛培理已經死了，沒有人喜歡他，他會被基督徒和所有的宗教錯過，一個非常特別的人。">President Donald Trump said on Twitter: "The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man."</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆於2013年11月7日在北卡羅萊納州阿什維爾的一家酒店慶祝了他的95歲生日，其中特朗普，商業巨頭魯珀特默多克和電視女主人凱西李吉福德是約800名客人。">Graham had celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 7, 2013, at a hotel in Asheville, North Carolina, where Trump, business magnate Rupert Murdoch and television hostess Kathie Lee Gifford were among some 800 guests.</p>
<p _translation="該活動展示了他的兒子富蘭克林所說的佈道視頻，這是格雷厄姆向全國傳遞的最後信息。在那裡，他說美國“非常需要精神上的覺醒”。">The event featured a video of a sermon that his son Franklin said was Graham’s last message to the nation. In it, he said America was "in great need of a spiritual awakening."</p>
<p _translation="格拉漢姆憑藉其鋼鐵般的特徵和炯炯有力的藍眼睛，在他巔峰時期傳教時，他是一個強大的人物，漫遊在舞台上，提起聖經，因為他宣稱耶穌基督是人類問題的唯一解決方案。">With his steely features and piercing blue eyes, Graham was a powerful figure when he preached in his prime, roaming the stage and hoisting a Bible as he declared Jesus Christ to be the only solution to humanity’s problems.</p>
<p _translation="在他的鼎盛時期，格雷厄姆以雷鳴般的快速演講風格贏得了他的綽號“上帝的機槍”。通過他的“基督的十字軍東征”，格雷厄姆在美國中心地區投入了熱愛的領域，這將成為宗教權利保守派政治運動發展的沃土。">In his heyday Graham had a thunderous, quick-burst speaking style that earned him the nickname "God’s Machine Gun." Through his "Crusades for Christ," Graham sowed fields of devotion across the American heartland that would become fertile ground for the growth of the religious right’s conservative political movement.</p>
<h2 _translation="白宮律師">White House counsel</h2>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆在哈里杜魯門任職期間開始與總統見面。他與杰拉爾德福特打高爾夫球，與林登約翰遜一起在白宮游泳池游泳，與喬治HW布什度假，並在尼克松執政的第一天在白宮過夜。">Graham started meeting with presidents during the tenure of Harry Truman. He played golf with Gerald Ford, skinny-dipped in the White House pool with Lyndon Johnson, vacationed with George HW Bush and spent the night in the White House on Nixon’s first day in office.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆成為幾位美國總統的事實上的白宮牧師，最著名的是理查德尼克松。">Graham became the de facto White House chaplain to several US presidents, most famously Richard Nixon.</p>
<p _translation="喬治·W·布什授予格雷厄姆的信譽，幫助他重新發現自己的信仰，2010年，當格雷厄姆難以出行時，巴拉克奧巴馬前往北卡羅來納州藍岭山脈的牧師小木屋。">George W Bush gave Graham credit for helping him rediscover his faith and in 2010, when it was difficult for Graham to travel, Barack Obama made the trip to the preacher’s log cabin home in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
<p _translation="他與白宮的關係是互利的。作為傳教士的傳道人，他的聲譽得到了提升，而政治家們則以傾向於選民的選民的身份提升了他們的地位。">His ties to the White House were mutually beneficial. His reputation was enhanced as preacher to the presidents, while the politicians boosted their standing with religiously inclined voters.</p>
<p _translation="“他們的個人生活 - 其中一些 - 很困難，”註冊民主黨人格雷厄姆在2007年向他的政治熟人透露時代雜誌。“但是我愛他們，我很欽佩他們，我知道他們的負擔超出了我所能理解或理解的範圍。”">"Their personal lives - some of them - were difficult," Graham, a registered Democrat, told Time magazine in 2007 of his political acquaintances. "But I loved them all. I admired them all. I knew that they had burdens beyond anything I could ever know or understand."</p>
<h2 _translation="政治觀點">Political views</h2>
<p _translation="在他職業生涯的前半期，格雷厄姆經常談及當時的社會和政治問題，包括他強烈的反共情緒。他將越南戰爭抗議者否認為註意力尋求者，儘管他最終拒絕舉行隔離復興會議，但他並未在1960年代的民權運動中發揮積極作用。">In the early half of his career, Graham often spoke his mind on social and political issues of the day, including his strong anti-communist sentiments. He dismissed Vietnam War protesters as attention-seekers and, while he eventually refused to hold segregated revival meetings, he did not take an active role in the 1960s civil rights movement.</p>
<p _translation="但是，格雷厄姆的政治並不像追隨他的一些宗教領袖那樣公開，比如1988年競選總統的帕特羅伯遜，以及旨在促進基督教的道德多數的共同創始人傑瑞福爾韋爾。以政治為導向。">But Graham’s politics were not as overt as those of some religious leaders who came after him, such as Pat Robertson, who ran for president in 1988, and Jerry Falwell, co-founder of the Moral Majority, an organization whose purpose was to promote Christian-oriented politics.</p>
<p _translation="隨著年齡的增長，格雷厄姆說他感覺自己已經過度捲入一些問題，並轉向中間位置以接觸更多的人。然而，他確實在2012年深入了解同性婚姻問題，當時他出面支持北卡羅來納州禁止同性婚姻的州修正案。他還在2012年10月與共和黨米特羅姆尼會面，並告訴他他支持羅姆尼競選總統。">As he grew older, Graham said he felt he had become too involved in some issues and shifted to a middle-of-the-road position in order to reach more people. He did, however, dive into the gay marriage issue in 2012 when he came out in support of a state amendment to ban same-sex marriages in North Carolina. He also met with Republican Mitt Romney in October 2012 and told him he supported Romney’s run for the presidency.</p>
<h2 _translation="從農場到講壇">From farm to pulpit</h2>
<p _translation="威廉富蘭克林格雷厄姆1918年11月7日出生於長老會家庭，在北卡羅來納州夏洛特附近的一個農場長大時被稱為比利弗蘭克。作為一名青少年，他說他大部分時間都忙於棒球和女孩，直到他在夏洛特聽到火熱的複興主義者之後被神感動。">William Franklin Graham was born on Nov. 7, 1918, into a Presbyterian family and was known as Billy Frank while growing up on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. As a teenager, he said he was mostly preoccupied with baseball and girls until he was moved by God after hearing a fiery revivalist in Charlotte.</p>
<p _translation="在參加鮑勃瓊斯學院後，格雷厄姆最終在佛羅里達的一所聖經學校學習，在那裡他會在第一次復興時宣講，並於1939年由南浸信會公會的一個教會任命。他在芝加哥附近的Wheaton大學獲得獎學金，在那裡他遇到了Ruth Bell，他的父母是中國的傳教士。他們於1943年結婚。">After attending Bob Jones College, Graham ended up at a Bible school in Florida, where he would preach at his first revival, and was ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention. He received a scholarship to Wheaton College near Chicago, where he met Ruth Bell, whose parents were missionaries in China. They married in 1943.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆沒有在家庭教堂工作，而是走上了路，在帳篷里傳教，並建立了一個關注。他的突破帶來了1949年的洛杉磯帳篷運動，原定三週，但由於他吸引的人潮過多而延長到八年。">Rather than work from a home church, Graham went on the road, preaching in tents and building a following. His breakthrough came with a 1949 Los Angeles tent crusade that was scheduled for three weeks but extended to eight because of the overflow crowds he attracted.</p>
<p _translation="洛杉磯戰役的成功以及格雷厄姆的成名歸功於媒體大亨威廉倫道夫赫斯特，他非常喜歡格雷厄姆的風格和反共立場，所以他命令他的報紙給格雷厄姆加油。">The success of the Los Angeles campaign and the fame it brought Graham was attributed to media magnate William Randolph Hearst, who had liked Graham’s style and anti-communist stance so much that he ordered his newspapers to give Graham a boost.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆最終超過了帳篷的複興，並將在世界上一些最著名的場地進行宣傳，如揚基體育場和紐約麥迪遜廣場花園以及倫敦溫布利大球場。他在世界各地發表講道，包括偏遠的非洲村莊，中國，朝鮮，蘇聯，東德，捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利。">Graham eventually outgrew tent revivals and would preach at some of the most famous venues in the world, such as Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden in New York and London’s Wembley Stadium. He delivered sermons around the globe, including in remote African villages, China, North Korea, the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</p>
<p _translation="自由派指責他給予虐待政府信譽，而原教旨主義基督徒則批評他去無神的國家並促進與他們的和平關係。格雷厄姆說他只是把這次旅行視為非政治機會為基督贏得靈魂。">Liberals accused him of giving credibility to abusive governments while fundamentalist Christians criticized him for going to godless countries and promoting peaceful relations with them. Graham said he simply saw the trips as apolitical opportunities to win souls for Christ.</p>
<p _translation="他的組織表示，格雷厄姆於2005年6月在紐約結束了他的宗教運動生涯，其三天展位吸引了超過23萬人參加。他把他的福音派協會交給了他的兒子富蘭克林，他不會迴避政治，並且一旦他成為總統，他就經常稱讚特朗普。">Graham concluded his career of religious campaigns in June 2005 in New York with a three-day stand that attracted more than 230,000 people, his organization said. He turned over his evangelical association to his son Franklin, who did not shy away from politics and frequently praised Trump once he became president.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆的其他四個孩子也是福音傳教士。">Graham’s other four children were also evangelists.</p>
<p _translation="他的組織說，計劃在3月2日在北卡羅來納州夏洛特的比利格雷厄姆圖書館門前舉行葬禮，場地可容納約2,300人。它說他將被安葬在他妻子露絲旁邊的圖書館。她於2007年6月14日去世。這對夫婦有兩個兒子和三個女兒。">A funeral at a venue that holds about 2,300 people is planned for March 2 in front of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, his organization said. It said he will be buried on library premises next to his wife, Ruth. She died on June 14, 2007. The couple had two sons and three daughters.</p>
<p _translation="家庭發言人Mark DeMoss表示，格雷厄姆的遺體將於下週一和周二安息在位於圖書館遺址的格雷厄姆家中，該家已從原來的位置搬到了夏洛特。">Graham’s body will lie in repose next Monday and Tuesday at the Graham family house which is now at the library site, having been moved from its original location, also in Charlotte, said family spokesman Mark DeMoss.</p>
<p _translation="當格雷厄姆在1950年開始他的事工時，他會在他稱之為“帆布大教堂”的帳篷下講道，“德莫斯說。他說，格雷厄姆在帳篷下的葬禮服務提醒他如何開始他的事工。">When Graham began his ministry in 1950, he would preach under a tent he called a "canvas cathedral," DeMoss said. He said having Graham’s funeral service under a tent is a reminder of how his ministry began.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆本人“幾年前親自批准了這項服務的規劃和細節”，德莫斯週三在夏洛特的新聞發布會上說。">Graham himself "personally approved the planning and details of the service some years ago," said DeMoss, speaking at a press conference in Charlotte on Wednesday night.</p>
<h2 _translation="聲譽">Reputation</h2>
<p _translation="儘管其他電視明星福音傳播者，如吉姆巴克爾和吉米斯瓦加特在20世紀80年代因金融和性醜聞而受到重創，格雷厄姆仍然保持著公信力。為了保持自己的聲譽，格雷厄姆有一個從不與露絲以外的任何女人單獨的政策。">Graham maintained his public integrity even as other TV star evangelists such as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart were hit in the 1980s by financial and sex scandals. To keep his reputation pristine, Graham had a policy of never being alone with any woman other than Ruth.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆最接近的總統關係是尼克松，尼克松向他提供了他想要的任何政府工作，包括駐以色列大使。對於格雷厄姆來說，這是一種痛苦的關係，尼克松和他的圈子在水門事件醜聞中誤導了他。">Graham’s closest presidential relationship was with Nixon, who offered him any government job he wanted - including ambassador to Israel. It turned out to be a painful relationship for Graham, who said Nixon and his circle misled him on the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p _translation="尼克松助手HR Haldeman在1994年的一本書中首次提到了格雷厄姆的反猶太言論，格雷厄姆堅決否認。但是，當尼克松白宮的錄音帶在2002年被釋放時，格雷厄姆可能聽說提及猶太人是色情作家，並同意尼克鬆的看法，認為美國媒體被自由派猶太人統治，並可能使美國“陷入困境”。">Nixon aide HR Haldeman first mentioned Graham’s anti-Semitic remarks in a 1994 book, which Graham strongly denied. But when audio tapes from the Nixon White House were released in 2002, Graham could be heard referring to Jews as pornographers and agreeing with Nixon that the US media was dominated by liberal Jews and could send the United States "down the drain."</p>
<p _translation="在支持以色列方面有著悠久歷史的格雷厄姆在磁帶發布後再次道歉，並表示他沒有回憶談話。">Graham, who had a long history of supporting Israel, apologized again after the tapes’ release and said he had no recollection of the conversation.</p>
<p _translation="“如果它不在錄像帶上，我不會相信它，”格雷厄姆告訴新聞周刊。“我想我正在努力討好，我對自己感覺如此糟糕 - 我無法相信，我和猶太領導人開了一次會，我告訴他們我會爬到他們那裡，要求他們原諒。">"If it wasn’t on tape, I would not have believed it," Graham told Newsweek. "I guess I was trying to please. I felt so badly about myself - I couldn’t believe it. I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness."</p>
<p _translation="超過二十多本著作如“如何重生”等書籍的作者，格雷厄姆在星期天在世界各地廣播了“每小時決定”廣播節目超過50年。">The author of more than two dozen books with titles such as "How to Be Born Again," Graham also ran the weekly "Hour of Decision" radio program broadcast around the world on Sundays for more than 50 years.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆幫助把宗教帶入電視時代。他首先在1951年製作了一個電視節目，最終集結在一起，並於1957年開始從紐約麥迪遜廣場花園直播他的複興會議。">Graham helped bring religion into the television age. He first put together a television show, which was eventually syndicated, in 1951 and began live broadcasts of his revival meetings in 1957 from New York’s Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p _translation="在2011年的福克斯新聞採訪中，格雷厄姆被問到他在職業生涯中會做些什麼不同。">In a 2011 Fox News interview, Graham was asked what he would do differently in his career.</p>
<p _translation="“我會學習更多，我會多禱告，少走路，少講演講，”他說。“我在世界上太多的地方把太多的人帶走了，如果我再把它做了，我會花更多的時間在冥想和祈禱上，只是告訴主，我有多愛他。”">"I would study more. I would pray more, travel less, take less speaking engagements," he said. "I took too many of them in too many places around the world. If I had it to do over again I’d spend more time in meditation and prayer and just telling the Lord how much I love him."</p>
<p _translation="除了患有帕金森病多年以外，格雷厄姆晚年的健康問題還包括髖部骨折，骨盆骨折，前列腺癌以及在他的大腦中安裝分流器以控制多餘的液體。他在2011年，2012年和2013年因呼吸問題住院。">In addition to suffering with Parkinson’s disease for many years, Graham’s health problems in his later years included a broken hip, a broken pelvis, prostate cancer and installation of a shunt in his brain to control excess fluid. He was hospitalized in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for respiratory problems.</p></div></div>
