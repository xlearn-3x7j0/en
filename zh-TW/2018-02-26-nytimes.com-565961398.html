On March 11, Cuba will hold elections for the National Assembly, which in turn will select the country’s next president on April 19. President Raúl Castro, brother of the late Fidel Castro, will not run for re-election. In 2012, he introduced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/world/americas/17cuba.html">term limits</a> and seems willing to honor them. The National Assembly is widely expected to choose a successor from outside the Castro family.</p><p data-para-count="217" data-total-count="703" _translation="我們對這次繼承有什麼看法？一個樂觀的解讀是，這可能是走向民主的第一步。一個更現實的解讀是，古巴正走向更多相同的：不民主的一黨統治。">What are we to make of this succession? One optimistic reading is that this could be the first step toward democracy. A more realistic reading is that Cuba is heading for more of the same: undemocratic one-party rule.</p><p data-para-count="256" data-total-count="959" _translation="如果古巴共產黨 - 允許參加一黨政權下的選舉的唯一一方 - 很聰明，那麼在獲得好的時候，它會試圖脫身。通過按照自己的條件向民主過渡，黨可以從中受益。">If the Cuban Communist Party — the only party allowed to participate in elections under the one-party regime — were smart, it would try to get out while the getting is good. By transitioning to democracy on its own terms, the party could reap benefits.</p><p data-para-count="270" data-total-count="1229" _translation="新配置的機構和法律（例如選舉法）可以根據其優勢量身定制。黨可以利用卡斯特羅的這種新自由為古巴人創造新的自由，從而產生可以轉化為選票的良好意願。">Newly configured institutions and laws (for example, electoral laws) could be tailor-made to its advantage. The party could take advantage of this new freedom from the Castros to produce new freedoms for Cubans, thus generating good will that could translate into votes.</p>
<p data-para-count="392" data-total-count="1621" id="story-continues-1" _translation="畢竟，在許多新民主國家中，舊的專制執政黨（或前獨裁者組成的政黨）仍然是著名的演員。在大多數情況下，這些“ 專制的繼承黨 ”可以自由公平地選舉回任。從墨西哥到蒙古，波蘭到巴拿馬，西班牙到韓國，台灣到突尼斯，選民都回到了“壞人”掌權。">After all, in many new democracies, the old authoritarian ruling parties (or parties formed by former authoritarians) remain prominent actors. In a majority of cases, these “<a href="https://kellogg.nd.edu/sites/default/files/old_files/documents/411.pdf">authoritarian successor parties</a>” are freely and fairly elected back into office.

And some authoritarian regimes can point to significant achievements. In the case of Cuba, the party could point to its record in the areas of free public services like health care, nationalism and <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/26/cuba-fidel-castro-was-hell/">domestic security</a>.</p><p data-para-count="172" data-total-count="2134" _translation="但共產黨等待的時間越長，這種退出策略就越不可行 - 而且黨最終會屈服於全面政權崩潰的可能性越大。">But the longer the Communists wait, the less viable this exit strategy becomes — and the more likely that the party will eventually succumb to full-blown regime collapse.</p><p data-para-count="377" data-total-count="2511" _translation="像古巴這樣的革命產生的獨裁政權往往能夠存活數十年，但是一旦革命的一代人死亡，尤其是他們無法找到其他合法性來源，比如近幾十年來中國經濟的非凡增長，他們就會陷入困境。出於這個原因，這個“金色降落傘”選項應該吸引古巴的統治者。">Authoritarian regimes born of revolutions such as Cuba’s often survive for decades, but <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/durability-revolutionary-regimes">they struggle once the revolutionary generation dies off</a> — especially if they cannot find an alternative source of legitimacy, such as China’s extraordinary economic growth in recent decades. For this reason, this “golden parachute” option should be appealing to Cuba’s rulers.</p><p data-para-count="415" data-total-count="2926" _translation="對古巴人民不幸的是，很少有跡象表明這種選擇正在被考慮。相反，大多數跡象表明繼續保持現狀 - 繼承非卡斯特羅，是的，但不是向更自由的政權過渡。古巴政權依然受到保護，免於國內壓力變得更加民主，即使最終這樣做是古巴共產黨的長遠利益。">Unfortunately for the Cuban people, there are few signs that this option is being considered. Instead, most signs point to a continuation of the status quo — a succession to a non-Castro, yes, but not a transition to a freer regime. The Cuban regime remains fairly protected from domestic pressures to become more democratic, even if it is ultimately in the Cuban Communist Party’s long-term interests to do so.</p><p data-para-count="352" data-total-count="3278" _translation="最明顯的是，雖然卡斯特羅先生將辭去總統職務，但他不會完全退休。他將繼續擔任共產黨的首腦，也是該國最重要的兩個機構 - 軍方的非官方首腦。當前獨裁統治者保留對國家關鍵部分的控制時，他們能夠否決任何潛在的民主開局。">Most obviously, while Mr. Castro will step down as president, he will not retire fully. He will remain head of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/raul-castro-re-elected-to-top-post-in-cubas-communist-party-1461092340">Communist Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article134121954.html">unofficial head of the military</a>, the country’s two most important institutions.

His son, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-castro/a-castro-son-rises-in-cuba-idUSKBN0OX1SU20150617">Alejandro</a>, runs the Ministry of the Interior, and his daughter, <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/05/26/lgbt-advocate-challenges-cuban-human-rights-record/">Mariela</a>, is a member of the National Assembly and the head of Cuba’s most important gender think tank, Cenesex. Alejandro is known for his love for efficiency, and Mariela for her love for L.G.B.T. causes. But neither is known for a love of liberal politics. The two devote a significant part of their time repressing (in the case of Alejandro) and belittling (in the case of Mariela) dissenters.</p><p data-para-count="627" data-total-count="4452" _translation="除了家庭本身，勞爾·卡斯特羅最重要的政策遺產 - 對經濟的軍事控制 - 很難被驅散。古巴軍方通過其集團Gaesa擁有絕大多數經營從事貿易業務的公司，從酒店到外匯交易所到港口，這使得它能夠控制高達60％的匯率硬通貨。任何經濟改革者都知道，打破壟斷是困難的，如果壟斷者也掌握著武器和智力的話更是如此。古巴的軍隊不僅承諾一黨一黨的統治，而且承諾一個企業的經濟。">Beyond the family itself is the fact that Raúl Castro’s most important policy legacy — military control of the economy — is hard to dislodge. The Cuban military, through its conglomerate Gaesa, owns the vast majority of firms that operate engaged in trade, from hotels to foreign exchange houses to ports, which gives it control of up to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-military/cuban-militarys-tentacles-reach-deep-into-economy-idUSKBN1962VK">60 percent of incoming hard currency</a>. Any economic reformer knows that breaking a monopoly is difficult, even more so if the monopolist also holds power over arms and intelligence. Cuba’s military is committed to not just one-party rule, but also, it seems, to one-firm economics.</p><p data-para-count="644" data-total-count="5096" _translation="而且由於古巴的經濟如此封閉，私營部門又小又薄弱。我們知道，向民主過渡要求有財富的演員遊說國家進行改革 - 也許會資助反對派。在菲德爾卡斯特羅的領導下，古巴實施了世界上最嚴厲的私人財產禁令之一，基本上阻止了這種可能性的發生。他的兄弟確實擴大了允許的自營職業活動的數量，但只有需要低技能的職業才被放開; 僱用和融資方面的巨大限制依然存在，稅收負擔很重。私營部門存在，但受到嚴重阻礙。">And because Cuba’s economy is so closed, the private sector is small and weak. We know that transitions to democracy require actors with wealth to lobby the state for change — and perhaps bankroll the opposition. Under Fidel Castro, Cuba enforced one of the world’s most draconian bans on private property, essentially foreclosing the possibility of this occurring. His brother did expand the number of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/open-for-business/">allowable self-employed activities</a>, but only professions requiring low skills were liberalized; huge restrictions on hiring and financing remain in place, and taxation is onerous. The private sector exists, but it is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-exclusive/exclusive-cuban-draft-rules-propose-curtailing-fledgling-private-sector-idUSKCN1G700I">severely hampered</a>.</p>

One would think that remittances could help democracy in Cuba by financing civil society. But because poverty is rampant and financing scarce, most remittances get used for <a href="http://www.cubatrademagazine.com/pipeline-private-sector/"> household consumption or self-employment activities</a>, with very little left over for the sorts of civic groups that are indispensable for democracy to emerge.</p><p data-para-count="233" data-total-count="6280" _translation="繼承之後，古巴的政權將繼續受到卡斯特羅家族，軍方以及旨在限製商業和政治組織發展的監管體系的影響，從而最大限度地減少民主化的壓力。">After the succession, Cuba’s regime will remain cornered by the Castro family, the military and by a regulatory system designed to restrict the growth of business and political organizations, minimizing the pressure to democratize.</p><p data-para-count="398" data-total-count="6678" _translation="也許在繼承後更大民主的唯一可能的壓力可能來自黨和軍隊之間的衝突。這些都是獨立的實體，每個實體都有自己的文化，資源和支持基礎。可以想像，黨和軍方之間最終發生的衝突可能會產生政治地震，這在理論上可能會產生政治過渡。">Perhaps the only possible pressure for greater democracy after the succession could come from a conflict between the party and the military. These are separate entities, each with its own culture, resources and base of support. It is conceivable that an eventual conflict between the party and the military could produce a political earthquake, which could in theory produce a political transition.</p><p data-para-count="199" data-total-count="6877" _translation="卡斯特羅先生比古巴人更了解這一點。這就是為什麼他可能會決定繼續負責這兩個集團，只要情況如此，自由古巴的潛力仍然有限。">Mr. Castro understands this better than anyone in Cuba.
