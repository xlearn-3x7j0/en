Though it still could face procedural obstacles, it has the support of a rare alliance of the Conservative government, the leadership of the opposition Labour Party, and the British medical establishment, indicating that chances of passage are good.</p><p data-para-count="240" data-total-count="910" _translation="“我很少看到如此一致的支持範圍，”擔任該法案的勞工立法者杰弗里羅賓遜說，他是周五發表贊成意見的兩個主要政黨中的幾十個人之一。“這將拯救生命。”">“I’ve seldom seen such a unanimous range of support,” said Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour lawmaker who sponsored the bill and who was one of dozens from both major parties who spoke in favor of it on Friday. “This will save lives.”</p><p data-para-count="218" data-total-count="1128" _translation="這一變化將適用於英格蘭。蘇格蘭議會也在考慮轉向選擇退出製度，而北愛爾蘭則需要明確的同意。自2015年以來，威爾斯已經推測同意捐贈器官。">The change would apply in England. The Scottish Parliament is also considering moving to an opt-out system, while Northern Ireland requires explicit consent. Wales has had presumed consent to organ donation since 2015.</p>

Though some of those rules have been in place for decades, most have been adopted in recent years; an opt-out system took effect in France last year, and the Dutch Parliament approved one this month.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>
