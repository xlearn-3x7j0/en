<p _translation="據報導，西班牙法院已決定不針對上週在巴塞羅那偷竊出租車的四名西布朗球員的案件。">A Spanish court has decided not to pursue a case against the four West Brom players who allegedly stole a taxi in Barcelona last week, according to reports.</p>
<p _translation="Jonny Evans，Gareth Barry，Jake Livermore和Boaz Myhill參加了一次事件，俱樂部正在參加溫暖的天氣訓練營和團隊練習。">Jonny Evans, Gareth Barry, Jake Livermore and Boaz Myhill were involved in an incident while the club was away on a warm-weather training camp and team-bonding exercise.</p>
<p _translation="當時他們接受了當地警方的採訪，但是由於沒有足夠的證據可以繼續處理這起案件，這個四人組似乎已經擺脫了懲罰，據報導，這個案件已被暫時駁回，但如果有新證據可以重新開庭。">They were interviewed by local police at the time, but the quartet appear set to escape punishment because there is insufficient evidence to continue with the case, which, reports say, has been provisionally dismissed but could be reopened if new evidence comes to light.</p>
<p _translation="新聞協會運動聯繫時，西布朗無法發表評論。">West Brom were unavailable for comment when contacted by Press Association Sport.</p>

<p _translation="四名球員周五在集體聲明中為打破宵禁道歉，但西布朗隊主教練帕里德表示，他對這起事件感到“憤怒”。">The four players apologised for breaking a curfew in a collective statement on Friday, but West Brom manager Alan Pardew has said he was left “furious” by the incident.</p>
<p _translation="巴塞羅那賽事增加了Pardew的熱度，Pardew在球場動盪和球場效果不佳的情況下一直是投機的主題。">Events in Barcelona increased the heat on Pardew, whose position has been the subject of speculation in the wake of boardroom upheaval and poor results on the pitch.</p>
<p _translation="星期六，帕杜在他的首發陣容中將埃文斯和巴里命名為英格蘭足總杯第三輪南安普頓在霍桑的比賽中敗北，但埃文斯被剝奪了隊長的職務。">Pardew named both Evans and Barry in his starting line-up for the FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Southampton at The Hawthorns on Saturday, although Evans was stripped of the captaincy.</p>
<div>

<p _translation="西布羅姆主教練阿蘭帕杜一直無法帶領俱樂部擺脫危險（Nick Potts / PA）。">West Brom manager Alan Pardew has been unable to lead the club away from danger (Nick Potts/PA).</p>
</div>
<p _translation="Pardew本週將決定是否將臂章交給前曼聯後衛或永久移除。">Pardew is set to decide this week whether to give the armband back to the former Manchester United defender or permanently remove it.</p>
<p _translation="自從Pardew在11月底開始控球以來，西布朗在所有比賽中只贏得17場比賽中的3場，並且在英超聯賽中排名第17位，落後於哈德斯菲爾德排名第17位，他們在周末的比賽中主場作戰。">Since Pardew took charge towards the end of November, West Brom have won just three of 17 matches in all competitions and are bottom of the Premier League, seven points adrift of 17th-placed Huddersfield, whom they host in a crucial clash at the weekend.</p>
<p _translation="上週Pardew的位置被削弱，而在巴塞羅那，有消息稱中國老闆賴國川已經解雇了董事長約翰威廉姆斯和首席執行官馬丁古德曼，他們都在任命這位56歲的老人。">Pardew’s position was weakened last week while in Barcelona with the news that Chinese owner Guochuan Lai had sacked chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodman, who were both instrumental in appointing the 56-year-old.</p></div>
