    <div id="body-200771816342556199"><p _translation="這名在伊朗被捕的英籍伊朗女子的丈夫已經在伊朗駐倫敦大使館門口留下信件，以求與一名來訪的伊朗官員會面。">The husband of the British-Iranian woman arrested in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a> has left letters on the doorstep of the Iranian embassy in London in a bid to secure a meeting with a visiting Iranian official.</p>
<p _translation="理查德拉特克利夫星期三告訴半島電視台，他正在寄希望於結束他的家庭遭受與伊朗外交部法律和國際事務代表阿巴斯·阿拉赫奇會面的考驗，他是在倫敦進行正式訪問的。">Richard Ratcliffe told Al Jazeera on Wednesday he was pinning his hopes for an end to his family's ordeal on a meeting with Abbas Araghchi, deputy for legal and international affairs in Iran's foreign ministry, who was in London for an official visit.</p>
<p _translation="大約兩年前，拉特克利夫從未去過伊朗的假期，因此他的妻子納扎寧扎加里拉特克利夫和他們的寶貝女兒加布里拉也沒有見過。"><span>Ratcliffe has not seen his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and their baby daughter, Gabriella, since they went for a holiday to Iran almost two years ago.</span></p>
<p _translation="“如果我們能夠召開這次會議，我顯然會變得更有希望，如果我們沒有參加會議，我會很樂意知道[阿拉賈奇]與英國官員會面時發生了什麼，”他說。"><span>"If we manage to get this meeting, I will obviously be much more hopeful. If we don't get the meeting, I will be keen to know what happened when [Araghchi] met with the British officials," he said.</span></p>
<p _translation="“我沒有放棄希望，但迄今沒有證據表明會議即將舉行。”">"I haven't given up hope, but so far there is no evidence that the meeting is going to happen."</p>
<h2 _translation="五年監禁期"><strong>Five-year jail term</strong></h2>
<p _translation="Nazanin是湯普森路透基金會的一名慈善工作者，他在2016年因被指控謀劃推翻伊朗政府而被定罪後，在德黑蘭的Evin監獄服刑5年。">Nazanin, a charity worker with the Thompson Reuters Foundation, is serving a five-year jail term in Tehran's Evin Prison after being convicted in 2016 for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Iranian government.</p>
<p _translation="她否認對她的指控。">She denies the allegations against her.</p>
<p _translation="據她的丈夫介紹，她在第一個八個半月的時間裡被單獨監禁。現在，她被允許接待遊客，她的母親每週會讓加布里埃拉見她兩次。&nbsp;">According to her husband, she spent the first eight-and-a-half months in solitary confinement. Now she is allowed to receive visitors, and her mother brings Gabriella to see her twice a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="“她已經夠了，她在心理上處於非常脆弱的狀態，”拉特克利夫說。">"She's just had enough. She is in a very fragile state psychologically," Ratcliffe said.</p>

<p _translation="上週二她在電話中對她的丈夫說話時，她說她再次發生恐慌和惡夢。">The last time she spoke to her husband over the phone on Tuesday she said she was having panic attacks and nightmares again.</p>
<p _translation="拉特克利夫說，納扎寧應該獲准臨時獲釋出獄，陪伴女兒。">Ratcliffe said Nazanin was supposed to be granted a temporary release from prison to spend time with her daughter.</p>
<p _translation="但檢察官辦公室在一個特殊的住所提供了軟禁，她將被安全人員看守，而不是與加布里埃拉住在家中。">But the prosecutor's office offered house arrest in a special accommodation where she would be guarded by security officers instead of staying in her family home with Gabriella.</p>
<p _translation="拉特克利夫也在周三表示，一小批維權人士和普通公民在大使館外舉行抗議活動，聲援拉特克利夫家族。">Also on Wednesday, Ratcliffe said a small group of human rights activists and ordinary citizens held a protest outside the embassy in solidarity with the Ratcliffe family.</p>
<p _translation="“我非常感動，很高興他們來了，知道她得到照顧，我們很在乎，”他說。“我認為[Nazanin]知道她並不孤單很重要。”">"I was very touched and pleased that they have come. Knowing that she is cared for and we are cared for is very important," he said. "I think it is important for [Nazanin] to know that she is not alone."</p>
