<p data-para-count="53" data-total-count="53" _translation="波蘭克拉科夫 - “我還應該去波蘭嗎？”">KRAKOW, Poland — “Should I still visit Poland?”</p><p data-para-count="439" data-total-count="492" _translation="在過去的兩周里，我曾計劃前往克拉科夫的旅行者問過這個問題，我在紐約長大後住了17年，然後在以色列度過了七年。他們擔心波蘭政府最近通過的“ 大屠殺法案 ”以及在國際外交層面以及波蘭公眾和全球猶太社區中爆發的口水戰。">I’ve been asked this question a lot in the last two weeks by people planning trips to Krakow, where I’ve lived for 17 years after growing up in New York and then spending seven years in Israel. They are worried about the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/europe/poland-death-camp-law.html">Holocaust bill</a>” recently passed by the Polish government and the war of words that erupted in response on the international diplomatic level, as well as among the Polish public and the global Jewish community.</p><p data-para-count="427" data-total-count="919" _translation="這種擔憂是真誠的，保證和讚賞的。我們這個波蘭的猶太社區正在經歷著充滿挑戰的時代。這些我們稱之為家的國家現在可能會覺得不太歡迎。一方面，剛剛發現自己猶太人根源的年輕人熱切地加入了在華沙和克拉科夫新開設的希勒爾學生組織。但他們認為未來會帶來什麼問題。">The concern is genuine, warranted and appreciated. We, the Polish Jewish community, are weathering challenging times. The country we call home can feel a little less welcoming these days. On one hand, young people who only recently discovered their Jewish roots have eagerly joined newly opened Hillel student organizations in Warsaw and Krakow. But they hold in the back of their minds a question of what the future may bring.</p><p data-para-count="452" data-total-count="1371" _translation="波蘭猶太領導人也正在努力應對一個不確定的未來，因為我們繼續在一個從民主轉向民粹主義的環境中建立猶太人生活。這種轉變對於猶太人或自由開放社會中的任何人都不是好兆頭。現在大屠殺法案將波蘭民族在大屠殺中的任何責任定為刑事犯罪，這可能會使我們與我們非猶太人鄰國的良好關係複雜化。">Polish Jewish leaders, too, are grappling with an uncertain future as we continue to build Jewish life in an environment that has taken a turn away from democracy toward populism. That shift is never a good sign for Jews — or anyone in a free and open society. And now the Holocaust bill, which criminalizes statements that the Polish nation had any responsibility in the Holocaust, may complicate our good relationship with our non-Jewish neighbors.</p><p data-para-count="501" data-total-count="1872" _translation="在過去的30年裡，在這些鄰居的幫助下我們設法重建的是真實的。這是強大的，它不僅來自政府的政策，而且來自基層的努力。我們通過與非猶太高中學生，老年人和許多其他人共同建造猶太教學校，猶太教堂，社區中心和博物館。他們不僅允許這些機構誕生並蓬勃發展，而且還有許多人站出來參與了猶太人的重生。">What we have managed to rebuild over the last 30 years with the help of those neighbors is real. It is strong and it has emerged not only from government policy, but also from grass-roots efforts. We’ve built Jewish schools, synagogues, community centers and museums by working hand in hand with non-Jewish high school students, senior citizens and many others. Not only have they allowed these institutions to be born and flourish, but many have stood up and taken an active part in Jewish rebirth.</p>
<p data-para-count="413" data-total-count="2285" id="story-continues-1" _translation="在希特勒和斯大林的軍隊於1939年入侵波蘭之前，這裡有350萬猶太人。戰爭和大屠殺數量減少到35萬人以下。在1945年至1989年的共產黨時期，這個數字一直在減少，當時猶太人感到不受歡迎，甚至被迫移民。在戰後的幾年中，還有約185,000人離開; 在五十年代後期又有五萬人，1968年則有一萬八千人。">Before Hitler’s and Stalin’s forces invaded Poland in 1939, it was home to 3.5 million Jews. The war and Holocaust reduced that number to 350,000 or less. The number kept shrinking during the Communist period from 1945 to 1989, when Jews were made to feel unwelcome and even forced to emigrate. In the immediate postwar years, about 185,000 left; another 50,000 did in the late 1950s, and some 18,000 in 1968.</p>

<p data-para-count="680" data-total-count="2965" _translation="在那些黑暗的日子裡，波蘭對西方是封閉的，這阻止了幾乎所有的準遊客旅行和支持猶太社區。波蘭猶太人感到孤獨，孤立於猶太人的世界，因為他們做出了是留下還是去的痛苦決定。那些經常留下來的人隱藏了他們的猶太身份，甚至是從他們自己的孩子身上，為了解決問題。當共產主義垮台時，沒有多少移民或他們的後代回來。這兩個因素讓人很難判斷在波蘭有多少猶太人留在這裡，但可能只有數万人。有些是倖存者的子孫，最近才知道他們有猶太人的根。">During those dark days, Poland was closed to the West, which prevented nearly all prospective visitors from traveling and supporting the Jewish community. Polish Jews felt alone, isolated from the Jewish world as they made the painful decision of whether to stay or go. Those who stayed frequently hid their Jewish identities, even from their own children, in order to get by. And when Communism fell, not many émigrés or their descendants returned. Those two factors have left it hard to gauge how many Jews remain in Poland, but it is probably in the low tens of thousands; some are children and grandchildren of survivors and only recently learned that they had Jewish roots.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

We aren’t sealed off from visitors. In the past couple of decades, our Jewish community has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors who have come to Poland to see the Nazi death camps, the shtetls where Jewish villagers once lived and the graves of great rabbis.</p><p data-para-count="317" data-total-count="3598" _translation="他們也發現了一些意想不到的事情：猶太生活重新出現。猶太人和非猶太人之間合作的奇蹟，相信通過共同努力，我們可以確保波蘭擁有明亮的猶太人未來。在此之後的17年中，我始終堅信這種合作將會持續下去。">They also have found something unexpected: Jewish life emerging anew. Nothing less than a miracle of cooperation between Jews and non-Jews who believe that by working together we can ensure that Poland has a bright Jewish future. And after 17 years here, I remain solidly optimistic that this cooperation will endure.</p><p data-para-count="507" data-total-count="4105" _translation="那些與我們社區有過接觸的遊客已經教會了我們並且被我們教過。他們在遇到想要進入猶太教機構並重新與他們的遺產重新聯繫的年輕波蘭猶太人之後，已經離開了人們。通過這次接觸，波蘭猶太人開始明白，他們不再孤單。他們不僅是一個更加接受的波蘭的一部分，而且也是一個大的，混亂的，複雜的和相互關聯的猶太人世界的一部分，這個世界已經開放的雙臂歡迎波蘭猶太人回到自己的位置。">Those visitors who have engaged with our communities have taught us and been taught by us. They have left invigorated after meeting young Polish Jews who are eager to enter Jewish institutions and reconnect to their heritage. And through this engagement, Polish Jews have come to understand that they are no longer alone. They are part of not only a more accepting Poland, but also of a big, messy, complex and interconnected Jewish world that has welcomed Polish Jews back into its own fold with open arms.</p><p data-para-count="322" data-total-count="4427" _translation="所以答案是：是的，來參觀波蘭。走在我無畏地走過的歷史悠久的街道上，作為一個驕傲的猶太人。看到難民營之外。超越歷史，既有美麗又有悲劇。與一個經歷過如此多痛苦的社區站在一起，但卻樂觀和渴望重新加入猶太人的世界。">So the answer is: Yes, come visit Poland. Walk down the historic streets that I walk without fear as a proud Jew. See beyond the camps. Go beyond the history, both the beautiful and the tragic. Stand with a community that has been through so much suffering, yet has emerged optimistic and eager to rejoin the Jewish world.</p><p data-para-count="172" data-total-count="4599" _translation="Your visit would not represent tacit acceptance of a misguided law.
