Sweden is the top-ranked team in the world right now. USA has the ability to play a simple style of curling but can also complicate the game and draw opponents into making mistakes. Many curlers in the game say Shuster has the ability to single-handedly win a curling game because of his shotmaking brilliance. He’ll need to do that today to propel the Americans to their first gold at the Olympics.</p><h4 data-para-count="32" data-total-count="9335" _translation="第四場結局：美國人偷點">4th End: Americans Steal a Point</h4><p data-para-count="421" data-total-count="9756" _translation="“是啊！是的！哇！哇！“這是美國人目前提供的配樂，這些人正在給瑞典人施加各種壓力。經過一次測量，美國偷走了一個點（瑞典有錘子）領先他們的比賽。對於約翰舒斯特和他的隊友來說，這是一件令人頭疼的事情。聽起來好像德盧斯所有的人都在江陵冰壺中心，而這些人都在尖叫。">“Yep! Yep! Whoa! Whoa!” This is the soundtrack being provided at the moment by the Americans, who are putting all sorts of pressure on the Swedes. After a measurement, the United States stole a point (Sweden had the hammer) to take their first lead of the match. This is heady stuff for John Shuster and his teammates. It sounds as if all of Duluth is here at Gangneung Curling Centre, and these people are screaming.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-12">Continue reading the main story</a>

Shuster and his team love to complicate the game and force their opponents into making mistakes. And that’s exactly what happened. Edin had a bad miss with his first. Shuster applied more pressure and on Edin’s last throw he was a little heavy and wide giving up a steal to the Americans.</p>

Americans want to force Sweden to a single point in the 5th end and try to keep the last rock in the 6th, 8th and 10th and final end.

It was a small but significant blunder, and Edin doesn’t usually make small but significant blunders.

The ice conditions change throughout the game due to rocks sliding over and over the ice. It can also change because of the body heat in the building, creating frost on the ice.
