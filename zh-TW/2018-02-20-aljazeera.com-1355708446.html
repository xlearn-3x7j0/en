<p _translation="在對卡塔爾進行正式訪問期間，茲維茲迪奇表示，該國正在實施包括反腐在內的政治和經濟改革，以加速其融入歐盟和北約的進程。">During an official visit to Qatar, Zvizdic said his country is implementing political and economic reforms, including fighting corruption, in its efforts to speed up its integration process into the EU and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/nato.html">NATO</a>.</p>
<p _translation="他認為這是波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那人民經濟繁榮，政治穩定和安全的道路。">He sees that as a path for economic prosperity, political stability and security for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p _translation="茲維茲迪奇說，他帶來了幾個經濟和投資項目給卡塔爾，價值超過20億美元。他表示，這些項目將幫助波斯尼亞為其公民創造更多就業機會，並加強他的國家與阿拉伯世界之間的貿易和投資機會。">Zvizdic said he brought with him several economic and investment projects to Qatar worth more than $2bn.

<p _translation="半島電視台：你訪問卡塔爾的本質是什麼，你在訪問期間想要完成什麼？"><strong>Al Jazeera: What is the nature of your visit to Qatar and what are you trying to accomplish during this visit?</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：波斯尼亞與卡塔爾的關係很好，可以追溯到25年前。我們認為卡塔爾 &nbsp;是波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那的真正朋友。此次訪問的關鍵目標是展現波斯尼亞的經濟潛力，並吸引卡塔爾投資，這對雙方都有利。&nbsp;"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: Bosnia has excellent relations with Qatar that goes back 25 years. We consider <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a>&nbsp;as a true friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The key goal of this visit is to present the economic potential of Bosnia and attract Qatari investments, which would benefit both countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p _translation="雖然波斯尼亞的主要外交政策目標是加入歐盟，但這並不意味著我們不應該向中東和阿拉伯世界伸出更好的經濟機會。">While the main foreign policy objective of Bosnia is to join the European Union, this does not mean that we should not reach out to the Middle East and the Arab world for better economic opportunities.</p>
<p _translation="阿拉伯世界目前正在投資波斯尼亞的經濟，如製造業，建築業，運輸業和食品業。總的來說，我們希望與西方和東方都有聯繫。">The Arab world is currently investing in the Bosnian economy in areas like manufacturing, construction, transportations and the food sector. Overall, we want to have ties with both the West and the East.</p>
<p _translation="半島電視台：波斯尼亞已於2016年提交加入歐盟的申請，該申請已被接受。波斯尼亞和黑塞哥維那希望通過加入歐盟和北約以及今天的事情來實現什麼？"><strong>Al Jazeera: Bosnia has submitted an application to join the EU in 2016 and the application was accepted. What does Bosnia and Herzegovina hope to accomplish by joining the EU and NATO and where things stand today?</strong></p>
<p _translation="茲維季奇：首先，波斯尼亞黑塞哥維那在觀念，文化，歷史和地理上都是一個決定性的歐洲國家。在過去三年中，歐盟和北約的一體化進程一直在加速。據最新調查顯示，波斯尼亞78％的人讚成加入歐盟。"><strong><strong>Zvizdic</strong>:</strong> First, Bosnia Herzegovina is a decidedly European country in terms of its outlook, culture, history and geography. In the last three years both EU and NATO integration process has been speeding up. According to the latest surveys, 78 percent of the people of Bosnia are in favour of joining the EU.</p>
<p _translation="到今年年底，我們預計北約行動計劃的激活和歐盟候選國的地位。我們心中無疑，我們肯定會成為歐盟。這是時間問題。">By the end of this year, we expect the activation of NATO action plan and achieve a candidate state status with the EU. There is no doubt in our mind that we will for sure become an EU. It is a matter of time.</p>
<p _translation="半島電視台：看起來你已將所有的財富堆積在歐盟成員身上，如果事情出錯了，你有計劃B嗎？"><strong>Al Jazeera: it looks like that you have stacked all of your fortunes on EU membership, what if things went wrong, do you have a plan B?</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：沒有計劃B，我們只有計劃A.我們的未來與歐盟和美國完全相關。歐盟是我們最強大的貿易夥伴，特別是德國。但是，沒有理由不與俄羅斯和土耳其等國建立良好的關係。"><strong><strong>Zvizdic</strong>:</strong> There is no plan B, we only have plan A. Our future is fully connected with the EU and the United states. The EU is our strongest trade partners especially Germany. However, there is no reason not to have good relations with other countries like Russia and Turkey.</p>
<p _translation="半島電視台：考慮到你的外交政策導向與歐盟和美國有關，俄羅斯是否在干涉你的內部政治，試圖破壞你在歐盟或北約的會員資格？"><strong>Al Jazeera: Considering that your foreign policy orientation is tied to the EU and the United States, is Russia meddling in your internal politics in an effort to derail your membership in either the EU or NATO?</strong></p>
<p _translation="茲維茲迪奇：俄羅斯有一些企圖影響西巴爾乾地區的政策。西巴爾幹向北約轉移實際上加劇了俄羅斯的影響。"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: There are certain attempts by Russia to influence policies in the western Balkans. The shifting of the western Balkans toward NATO is actually aggravating Russia.</p>
<p _translation="我們希望與俄羅斯有良好的經濟聯繫。但是，我們將未來看作是歐盟的一部分。&nbsp;">We want to have good economic ties with Russia. However, we see our future as part of the EU.&nbsp;</p>

<p _translation="半島電視台：作為一個多國聯邦的國家，在歐盟的整合和成員資格是否會解決波斯尼亞最棘手的問題，例如它在90年代血腥內戰之後沿著民族和種族界限創建的複雜政治體系，以及其經濟不穩定？ "><strong>Al Jazeera: As a multi-national federation state, would integration and membership in the EU solve Bosnia's thorniest problems such as its complex political system that was created along national and ethnic lines in the aftermath of the bloody civil war during the '90s, and its economic instability? </strong></p>
<p _translation="考慮到像希臘這樣的國家，這個國家儘管是歐盟成員，但卻經濟不穩定。"><strong>This, considering that countries like Greece for example, suffers from deep economic instability despite being an EU member.</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：當我們成為歐盟成員時，兩個關鍵問題將得到解決："><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: When we become members of the EU, two key issues will be resolved:</p>
<p _translation="第一，通過解決與巴爾幹西部邊界有關的問題來實現安全和穩定。歐盟委員會強調，巴爾幹西部，波斯尼亞，塞爾維亞，克羅地亞，黑山和科索沃等六個國家必須解決邊界爭端，然後才能升格為全面的歐盟成員國。">One - it will accomplish security and stability by resolving the issues related to the borders in the western Balkans. The EU commission has emphasized that the six countries in the western Balkans, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia Montenegro and Kosovo must resolve their border disputes before ascending to full EU membership.</p>
<p _translation="當邊界問題得到解決後，它將停止任何一方的想法或企圖改變它，因此它會帶來政治穩定和安全">When the border issues are resolved, it will halt any ideas or attempts by any party to change it, and thus it will bring political stability and security</p>
<p _translation="兩個 - 歐盟和北約成員國將導致經濟繁榮。希臘遭受經濟問題，因為它沒有實施推薦的歐盟經濟措施，這將有助於擺脫經濟衰退。">Two - the EU and NATO membership will result in economic prosperity. Greece suffers economic problems because it did not implement the recommended EU economic measures that would have helped it out of its economic slump.</p>
<p _translation="但以羅馬尼亞，保加利亞和斯洛文尼亞等國家為例，這些國家是遵循歐盟措施和標準的東歐國家的典範，儘管最初對人口造成了嚴重的影響，但從長遠來看，它最終會變得更好，更加繁榮。">But take for example countries like Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia which are good examples of East European countries that followed the EU measures and standards and that despite the initial painful impact on the population, it ended up better off and more prosperous in the long run.</p>
<p _translation="半島電視台：波斯尼亞大選將於今年10月舉行，這是否解釋了來自該國不同國家群體的民族主義言論的興起，你打算競選總統嗎？"><strong>Al Jazeera: The general elections in Bosnia are slated to take place this October, does that explain the rise of nationalistic rhetoric from the different national groups in the country and are you planning to run for president?</strong></p>
<p _translation="茲維茲迪奇：至於競選總統，也許我會說，我可能會競選總統，屆時我們會看到會發生什麼。"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: As for as running for president, I would say maybe, I might run for president, we will see what happens when the time comes.</p>
<p _translation="至於問題的另一部分，自從選舉以來，所有群體的言論崛起並不罕見。這已成為波黑選舉政治中的典型代表。然而，一旦選舉結束，言辭就會消退，政治平衡和對現實的回歸就會持續下去。">As for the other part of the question, since its election season, it is not unusual to see the rise of rhetoric from all groups. This has become typical in Bosnian electoral politics. However, once the election is over, the rhetoric subsides and a political balance and a return to reality takes hold.</p>

<p _translation="半島電視台：波斯尼亞有民主希望嗎？該地區的其他國家似乎已經開始好轉，為什麼波斯尼亞沒有？"><strong>Al Jazeera: Is there hope for democracy in Bosnia? Other countries in the region have seemingly moved on and became better off, why hasn’t Bosnia?</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：我不同意在這方面評估其他巴爾幹國家比波斯尼亞好。我們的地區經歷了共產主義和專制政權太久。向民主過渡需要時間，需要改變思想，文化和價值觀。"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: I disagree with the assessment that other Balkan countries are better off than Bosnia in that respect. Our region has lived through communism and authoritarian regimes for too long. The transition to democracy takes time and it requires a change in thinking, culture and values.</p>
<p _translation="民主和自由市場經濟的原則必須為我們地區所接受。但是，漸漸地，我們正朝著這個方向前進。">The principles of democracy and free market economy must be accepted by our region. Gradually, however, we are heading in that direction.</p>
