<p _translation="“我們不知道發生了什麼或&nbsp;我父親在哪裡，起初我們甚至不知道他是死還是活，”他女兒阿雅侯賽因回憶道。">"We didn't know <span>what was happening or&nbsp;</span>where my father was. At first, we didn't even know if he was dead or alive," recalls his daughter Aya Hussein.</p>
<p _translation="對卡塔爾多哈的埃及國民&nbsp; 侯賽因沒有任何正式指控&nbsp;。他被指控“煽動國家機構並以傳播混亂為目的播放虛假新聞”。&nbsp;"><span><span>There have been no formal charges against Hussein, an&nbsp;</span>Egyptian national based in Doha,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html">Qatar</a>.

<p _translation="半島電視台已經拒絕了對侯賽因的指控，並呼籲埃及無條件釋放他。">Al Jazeera has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/egypt-renews-mahmoud-hussein-detention-11th-time-180127172302645.html">rejected</a> the allegations against Hussein and has called on <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a> to unconditionally release him.</p>
<p _translation="他的拘留是埃及當局在該網絡工作人員一系列逮捕的最新情況。">His detention is the latest in a series of arrests by Egyptian authorities of the network's staff there.</p>
<p _translation="2016年5月，Al Jazeera Arabic的前主編Ibrahim Helal因缺乏國家安全而被缺席判處死刑。其他幾位同事也被指控缺席，如記者&nbsp; 蘇特頓和多米尼克凱恩。">In May 2016, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/al-jazeera-ibrahim-hilal-slams-egypt-death-verdict-160507133545255.html">Ibrahim Helal</a>, former editor-in-chief of Al Jazeera Arabic, was sentenced to death in absentia for purportedly endangering national security.

<p _translation="當你監禁一名記者時，這是對新聞自由和言論自由的攻擊。這並不意味著記者超越了法律。作為每個公民，我們都有責任尊重法律。我無法無故偷盜或殺人。但這些記者發生的事情就是我們所說的“新聞工作的刑事化”，即你把他們的工作形容為犯罪，這是對新聞自由的攻擊。">When you jail a journalist, it is an attack on press freedom and freedom of expression. This doesn't mean journalists are above the law. We have, as every citizen, the duty to respect the law. I can't steal or kill someone without any reason. But what happened with these journalists is what we call "criminalisation of journalistic work", namely, you describe their work as a crime and that is an attack against press freedom.</p>

<p _translation="“根據我們2016年的統計數據，我們注意到由於他們的工作，至少有20名記者因為工作而被關在酒吧里，”無國界記者組織的Alexandra El Khazen說。“他們會發現自己正在和其他數百人一起進行集體政治審判，指責他們是政治性的，因為他們的新聞工作，好像他們是活動家或恐怖分子。”">"According to our statistics in 2016, we noticed there were at least 20 journalists behind bars because of their work," says Alexandra El Khazen from Reporters Without Borders. "They'd find themselves in a group political trial with hundreds of others accused. The accusations against them are political, because of their journalistic work, as if they were activists or terrorists."</p>
<p _translation="羅伯特肯尼迪人權組織的國際律師韋德麥克馬倫說，“埃及政府正在大量採用我們看到的世界各地壓制政權為了限制公民空間而採用的所有工具所以直接恐嚇，騷擾，逮捕維權人士，記者和活動分子，一旦被逮捕，然後被拘留，就會受到酷刑和虐待。“">Wade McMullen, an international lawyer for the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights group, says that "the state [Egypt] is pretty much employing all the tools that we see repressive regimes around the world employ in order to restrict civic space, all at once. So there is direct intimidation, harassment, arrest of human rights defenders and journalists and activists, torture and mistreatment of those individuals once they are arrested and then detained."</p>
<p _translation="埃及媒體也參與抹黑馬哈茂德侯賽因。電視頻道發起了一項反對一個曾經是同事的人的運動，他在埃及國家媒體開始他的職業生涯，然後擔任政府開辦的尼羅河電視頻道的首席記者。">The Egyptian media has also played a part in discrediting Mahmoud Hussein. TV channels launched a campaign against a man who was once a colleague, having started his career in Egyptian state media and then worked as chief correspondent for the government-run Nile TV channel.</p>
<p _translation="“在電視上，他們說他是一個恐怖分子和散播虛假新聞的人，他們說他運行了一個秘密網絡來傳播這個國家的混亂，他們都是毫無根據的指責，”Aya Hussein說。">"On TV, they said he was a terrorist and someone who disseminated false news. They said he ran a secret network to spread chaos in the country. They were all baseless accusations," says Aya Hussein.</p>
<p _translation="馬哈茂德侯賽因現任的同事稱他為值得信賴，熱情和經驗豐富的記者。半島電視台阿拉伯主持人穆罕默德克里申說：“他客觀地完成了他的工作，他的報告文學一直保持平衡和專業。”">Mahmoud Hussein's current colleagues describe him as a trustworthy, passionate and experienced journalist. Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Mohammad Krichen says, "He did his job objectively. He always maintained balance and professionalism in his reportage."</p>

<p _translation="“馬哈茂德的媒體經驗非常豐富，他曾與許多電視頻道合作，”馬哈茂德侯賽因的終身朋友阿納斯扎基說。“他曾擔任過幾個阿拉伯電視頻道的開羅頻道主管，他曾幾十次前往幾個阿拉伯國家，特別是巴勒斯坦......馬哈茂德並不復雜，他討論了所有的觀點，並對所有觀點持開放態度，不管意識形態如何，他都與伊斯蘭主義者，自由主義者和納賽爾派成為朋友。“">"Mahmoud's media experience is very rich. He has worked with many TV channels," says Anas Zaki, a lifelong friend of Mahmoud Hussein. "He served as Cairo bureau chief for a couple of Arab TV channels. He travelled dozens of times to several Arab countries, especially Palestine ... Mahmoud isn't complicated. He discusses all opinions and is open to all viewpoints. He doesn't anchor his personal relationships in ideology, politics or even religion. He is friends with Islamists, liberals and Nasserites, regardless of ideology."</p>
<p _translation="幾個機構已經要求埃及政府解釋為什麼馬哈茂德侯賽因未經審判就被囚禁; 並在2018年2月，聯合國要求立即釋放。">Several agencies have asked the Egyptian government to explain why Mahmoud Hussein has been imprisoned without trial; and, in February 2018, the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">UN</a> called for his immediate release.</p>
<p _translation="“ 國際記者聯合會主席Philippe Leruth解釋說：”我們一旦將他拘留給埃及總統阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·西西和埃及駐布魯塞爾大使館，就立即致函，因為它靠近IFJ辦公室。">"We wrote letters as soon as he was detained to the Egyptian President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> and to the Egyptian embassy in Brussels because it is close to the IFJ office," explains Philippe Leruth, president of the International Federation of Journalists.</p>
<p _translation="“我們譴責他被監禁的事實，並問我們為什麼我們的同事被拘留，我們沒有收到埃及當局的答复，我們還寫信給聯合國秘書長，那時是潘基文先生，譴責這一事實，聯合國擔心埃及的新聞自由狀況。“">"We denounced the fact that he was jailed and asked why precisely our colleague was detained. We received no answer from the Egyptian authorities. We also wrote letters to the United Nations secretary-general, who was Mr Ban Ki Moon by that time, to denounce the fact and the United Nations worry about the press freedom situation in Egypt in general."</p>
<p _translation="馬哈茂德侯賽因在沒有正當程序的情況下仍然在埃及監獄。在與釋放阿卜杜拉艾爾沙米，巴赫穆罕默德，穆罕默德法赫米和彼得格雷斯特的活動相同的旗幟下，有很多表達聲援侯賽因的人：新聞不是犯罪。">Mahmoud Hussein remains in Egyptian jail without due process. There have been many expressions of solidarity with Hussein, under the same banner as the campaign to free Abdullah Elshamy, Baher Mohammed, Mohammed Fahmy and Peter Greste: <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/journalism-not-crime.html">Journalism Is Not A Crime</a>.</p>
