<p _translation="意大利即將舉行的大選已經被視為對歐洲的考驗，因為右翼民粹主義日益增多，人們對移民的焦慮加劇。">Italy's upcoming election has been billed as a test for <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a> amid growing right-wing populism and increasing anxiety over migration.</p>
<p _translation="由於&nbsp;經濟停滯和極右翼政黨對整個非洲大陸的收益普遍&nbsp; 感到憤怒，意大利人將在3月4日投票選舉新政府。">With widespread&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/italian-elections-crisis-european-democracy-180216185914053.html">anger</a>&nbsp;over economic stagnation and far-right parties making gains across the continent, Italians will cast their ballots to choose a new government on March 4.</p>
<p _translation="該國許多政界人士都將焦點集中在難民和移民問題上，其中近12萬人2017年抵達意大利。">Many of the country's politicians have <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/italy-exploits-migration-crisis-180114200719130.html">focused their ire</a> on refugees and migrants, nearly 120,000 of whom <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/italy/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-5502-2018-deaths-reach-213" target="_blank">arrived</a> in Italy in 2017.</p>
<p _translation="在反對移民的各方當中包括民粹主義者五星運動（M5S），聯盟（也稱為北方聯盟），自稱法西斯黨的卡薩邦普和新法西斯主義者Forza Nuova。">Among the parties railing against immigration are the populist <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/can-beppe-grillo-internet-demo-2014823124259908116.html">Five Star Movement</a> (M5S), The League (also known as the Northern League), the self-professed fascist party <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/remembering-italy-cervi-brothers-surge-180213164326651.html">CasaPound</a> and the neo-fascist Forza Nuova.</p>
<h2 _translation="預計什麼？">What's expected?</h2>
<p _translation="根據最近的民意調查顯示，各方目前都沒有指定創建政府所需的40％的必要支持水平，這是去年在新法律中引入的一項要求。">According to recent polls, none of the parties currently command the requisite 40 percent support level needed to create a government, a requirement that was introduced in a new law last year.</p>
<p _translation="在這種情況下，總統必須找到一個建立政府的跨黨派解決方案，必須組建一個大聯合政府，否則意大利人如果沒有就可行的政府達成一致，就會回到民意調查中。">In such a scenario, the president would have to find a cross-party solution to create a government, a grand coalition would have to be formed, or Italians would head back to the polls if no workable government is agreed upon.</p>
<p _translation="格魯吉亞大學公共與國際事務學院副教授Cas Mudde解釋說，沒有一次選舉可能是對更廣泛民粹主義現象的考驗。">Cas Mudde, an associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia, explained that no single election could be a test for the broader populist phenomenon.</p>
<p _translation="“最重要的是，意大利一直是一個離群點，具有堅實的民粹主義傳統至少可以追溯到20世紀90年代初，”Mudde說，他的學者專注於民粹主義，告訴半島電視台。">"On top of that, Italy has long been an outlier, with a solid populist tradition going back at least till the early 1990s," Mudde, whose scholarship has focused on populism, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="“它也有非常特殊的經濟和政治環境。”">"It also has very particular economic and political circumstances."</p>
<h2 _translation="貝盧斯科尼在最右邊的床上嗎？">Is Berlusconi in bed with the far right?</h2>
<p _translation="西爾維奧貝盧斯科尼的Forza Italia晚會與The League達成協議，由極右派政治家Matteo Salvini和一對較小的右翼政黨領導。&nbsp;">Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party has struck a deal with The League, headed by far-right politician Matteo Salvini and a pair of smaller right-wing parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="雖然貝盧斯科尼在選舉中被禁止參加競選，但由於2013年的稅務欺詐罪，該黨領導的集團截至上周平均投票率為36％。">While Berlusconi is personally barred from running in the elections, owing to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, the bloc led by his party was polling at an average of 36 percent as of last week.</p>

<p _translation="過去，媒體大亨貝盧斯科尼曾擔任總理九年總理，使他成為自第二次世界大戰結束後服務時間最長的統治者。">In the past, Berlusconi, a media tycoon, served as prime minister for a combined total of nine years, making him the country's longest-serving ruler since the end of the Second World War.</p>

<p _translation="薩爾維尼已經承諾驅逐50萬難民和移民。本月早些時候，馬切拉塔前聯盟本地候選人 被懷疑發生車禍槍擊，打傷 &nbsp;6名非洲移民。">Salvini has pledged to deport upwards of half a million refugees and migrants. Earlier this month, a former local candidate for the League in Macerata<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/words-african-victims-gun-attack-180211054550845.html"> </a>was suspected of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/words-african-victims-gun-attack-180211054550845.html">shooting and injuring</a>&nbsp;six African migrants in a drive-by shooting.</p>
<p _translation="儘管Salvini過去曾對歐盟提出過指責，但他表示，他不會就意大利加入這個28個國家的集團進行公民投票。">Although Salvini has railed in the past against the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>, he has said he will not seek a referendum on Italy's membership in the 28-country bloc.</p>
<p _translation="英國伯明翰大學歐洲政治學高級講師丹尼爾·阿爾伯塔齊說，貝盧斯科尼與右翼政黨的聯盟是“非常成熟”的關係的一部分。">Daniele Albertazzi, a senior lecturer in European politics at Birmingham University in the UK, said that the Berlusconi alliance with right-wing parties is part of a "very well established" relationship.</p>
<p _translation="“貝盧斯科尼曾四次擔任總理，他一直得到北部聯盟的支持，”他告訴半島電視台。">"Berlusconi has been prime minister four times, and he's always had the support of the Northern League," he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<h2 _translation="左邊站在哪裡？">Where does the left stand?</h2>
<p _translation="2007年成立的是將不同中左翼政黨聯合起來，目前控制執政聯盟的民主黨（PD）投票率約為23％。">Founded to bring together disparate centre-left parties in 2007, the Democratic Party (PD), which currently controls the governing coalition, is polling at around 23 percent.</p>
<p _translation="在前總理馬蒂奧倫齊（2014-2016）的領導下，該黨近幾個月來失去了大部分支持。">Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (2014-2016), the party has lost much of its support in recent months.</p>
<p _translation="根據日報Corriere della Sera的調查，該國現任總理兼PD成員Paolo Gentiloni是民調中最受歡迎的個人政治家，支持率為47％。">Paolo Gentiloni, the country's current prime minister and a PD member, is the most popular individual politician in the polls, with an approval rating of 47 percent, according to&nbsp;a survey&nbsp;in the daily Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p _translation="自2014年贏得超過40％的選票以來，效績數據穩步失去了支持。僅僅兩年後，M5S在羅馬和都靈的地區選舉中超過了PD。&nbsp;">The PD has steadily lost support since it last won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2014. Just two years later, M5S&nbsp;surpassed PD&nbsp;in Rome and Turin in regional elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="阿爾伯塔奇解釋說，支持PD的下降可以歸因於幾個因素，其中包括Renzi 2016年失敗的憲法改革公投，導致他辭職。">Albertazzi explained that the decline in support for PD can be attributed to several factors, among them Renzi's failed 2016 constitutional reform referendum that led to his resignation.</p>
<p _translation="艾伯塔奇補充說，其主要原因之一是PD已經失去了之前大部分基地的支持，因為它“沒有明確的信息”。">One of the primary reasons the PD has lost the support of much of its previous base is that it "has no clear message", Albertazzi added.</p>
<p _translation="“沒有人知道PD的意義，但每個人都知道貝盧斯科尼的目標。”">"No one knows what the PD stands for, but everyone knows what Berlusconi is for."</p>
<p _translation="當地媒體已經觀察到，該黨的主要問題似乎是缺乏潛在的聯盟夥伴，可能使其無法維持其在政府中的作用。">Local media has observed that the party's primary problem appears to be the lack of potential coalition partners, likely rendering it unable to maintain its role in the government.</p>
<h2 _translation="這位喜劇演員的反建立黨成了什麼？">What has become of the comedian's anti-establishment party?</h2>
<p _translation="M5S平均投票率為28％，成為選舉前最受歡迎的個人派對。">M5S&nbsp;was polling at an average of 28 percent, making it the most popular individual party ahead of the elections.</p>
<p _translation="這個派對由喜劇演員Beppe Grillo於2009年創立，被形容為反建立，Eurosceptic和親環境。">Founded in 2009 by a comedian, Beppe Grillo, the party has been described as anti-establishment, Eurosceptic and pro-environment.</p>
<p _translation="M5S排除了在選舉前建立聯盟的潛力。">M5S ruled out the potential of creating a coalition before the elections.</p>
<p _translation="最近發現，有幾名黨員因未能將一半的工資捐給小企業而違反了M5S協議。">It was recently revealed that several party members had broken M5S protocol by failing to donate half of their salaries to small business.</p>

<p _translation="2017年9月被選為M5S總理後接任的領導人Luigi di Maio已承諾在國家參選之前驅逐黨內“壞蘋果”。">Leader Luigi di Maio, who took over in September 2017 after being voted M5S prime minister, has promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/italys-m5s-party-leader-promises-to-expel-bad-apples-before-election" target="_blank">expel</a> "bad apples" from the party before the nation takes to the ballots.</p>
<p _translation="然而，觀察家們指出，醜聞在民意調查中似乎對M5S影響不大。">Yet, the scandal appeared to have little impact on M5S in the polls, observers have noted.</p>
<p _translation="儘管該黨拒絕了傳統政治的左右兩分法，但M5S是歐洲議會自由與直接民主歐洲的成員。">Although the party has rejected the left-right dichotomy of traditional politics, M5S is a member of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy in the European Parliament.</p>
<p _translation="該組包括右翼政黨，如英國的英國獨立黨（UKIP）和超民族主義者瑞典民主黨。">That group includes right-wing parties, such as the United Kingdom's UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the ultra-nationalist Sweden Democrats.</p>
<p _translation="解釋M5S採用了通常與左右相關的職位組合，並重點關注互聯網接入和環境等問題，Mudde將該黨形容為“非結構化的組織和領導者，他們遠離實際政治“。">Explaining that M5S had adopted a combination of positions typically associated with the left and the right, along with a focus on issues like internet access and the environment, Mudde described the party as having "an amorphous structure and a leader who stays out of practical politics".</p>
<p _translation="“這使得很難找出誰為派對說話”，Mudde說。&nbsp;">This "makes it very hard to figure out who speaks for the party", Mudde said.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="他補充說：“在過去的幾年裡，他們越來越像是一個民粹主義激進的右派，但是，他們越來越反對移民和歐洲的觀念。”">He added: "In the past years they have become more and more like a populist radical right party, however, being increasingly anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic."</p>
<p _translation="儘管M5S一直主張退出歐盟和歐元，歐元是許多成員國使用的統一歐洲貨幣，但其領導人最近表示，它&nbsp;寧願&nbsp;暫時留在集團內部。"><span>Although M5S has consistently advocated leaving the EU and the euro, the unified European currency used in many member states, its leader recently said that it&nbsp;</span>preferred to stay<span>&nbsp;in the bloc for the time being.</span></p>
<h2 _translation="預計最遠的權利會有所增加嗎？">Is the far right expected to gain ground?</h2>
<p _translation="CasaPound成立於2003年，將自己形容為法西斯主義者。它被指控對政治反對派和尋求庇護者實施暴力，它一貫否認這一指控。">CasaPound was established in 2003 and describes itself as fascist. It has been accused of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/anti-fascists-vow-fight-mussolini-loving-militants-180116190056142.html">carrying out violence</a> against political opponents and asylum seekers, charges it consistently denies.</p>
<p _translation="Forza Nuova成立於1997年，也讚揚法西斯統治者Benito Mussolini的遺產，並一直處於反移民組織的第一線。">Founded in 1997, Forza Nuova also hails the legacy of fascist ruler Benito Mussolini and has been on the front line of anti-migrant organising.</p>
<p _translation="雙方都主張驅逐難民和移民。">Both parties advocate the expulsion of refugees and migrants.</p>
<p _translation="據分析人士稱，雖然CasaPound和Forza Nuova都不會讓政界人士陷入政府，但他們對國家話語的影響越來越大，特別是在移民方面。">While neither CasaPound nor Forza Nuova is likely to land politicians in the government, they have had an increasingly significant impact on the national discourse, particularly regarding migration, according to analysts.</p>

<p _translation="11月，CasaPound在羅馬的奧斯蒂亞區抓住了9％的選票，引發了評論家和政治對手的擔憂。">In November, CasaPound grabbed nine percent of the vote in Rome's Ostia district, sparking fears among critics and political opponents.</p>
<p _translation="“不僅僅是數量的增長，它們組織方式的可見性和有效性也有所增長，”Extreme Right，一本關於歐洲最右邊的書的作者Guido Caldiron告訴Al Jazeera。">"More than a growth in numbers, there has been a growth in visibility and efficacy in the way they organise," Guido Caldiron, author of Extreme Right, a book about the far right in Europe, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="“在20世紀90年代，Forza Nuova嘗試過但從未成功創建過真正的派對，但它更像是一場運動，”他解釋道。">"In the 1990s, Forza Nuova tried but never succeeded to create a real party, but it was more of a movement," he explained.</p>
<p _translation="“現在[最右邊]與主流政治有更緊密的聯繫，”他說，他認為CasaPound和Forza Nuova已經影響了聯盟等更大黨派的言辭。&nbsp;">"Now [the far right] has a stronger link with mainstream politics," he said, arguing that CasaPound and Forza Nuova have influenced the rhetoric of larger parties like the League.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="卡爾德隆補充說：“這一新浪潮伴隨著意大利普遍權利的增長......自從90年代貝盧斯科尼時代以來，他們已經合法化，他們稱自己為法西斯的事實不再是醜聞。”">Caldiron added: "This new wave goes along with the growth of the right in general in Italy … They have been legitimised since the Berlusconi era of the 90s. The fact that they call themselves fascists is no longer a scandal."</p></div></div>
