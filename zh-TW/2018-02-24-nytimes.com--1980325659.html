The committee, known as Cfius, plays an advisory role to the president, but it can effectively block foreign acquisitions of American companies over national security concerns.</p><p data-para-count="318" data-total-count="1288" _translation="Tacelli先生說：“儘管我們盡最大努力來獲得批准，但顯然Cfius不會清除這筆交易。” 這筆交易最終將由中國集成電路產業投資基金提供資金，中國集成電路產業投資基金是一個價值210億美元的基金，將數家中國國營公司列為投資者。">“Despite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that Cfius will not clear this transaction,” Mr. Tacelli said. The deal would ultimately have been financed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, a $21 billion fund that counts several Chinese state-run companies as investors.</p>

Under President Barack Obama, regulators showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/dealbook/china-aixtron-obama-cfius.html">increased skepticism</a> about Chinese deals involving technology companies.
