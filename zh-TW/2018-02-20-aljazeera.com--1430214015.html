<p _translation="“樂施會承認他們的工作人員在2011年使用妓女，他們承認了所有的證據，他們甚至使用他們的辦公室進行此類活動。現在我們正在努力查看是否有掩蓋，因為他們的報告從未提交給海地當局，“ 他說。">"Oxfam admits the use of prostitutes by their staff in 2011, they admitted with all the evidence, They even used their offices for such activities. Now we are working to see if there were cover up because their report never made it to the Haitian authorities," he said.</p>
