<p _translation="“我们认为谈判是实现和平的唯一途径，因此我们如何拒绝谈判？” 他说。">"We believe negotiations are the only path towards peace so how can we reject negotiations?" he said.</p>

<p _translation="阿巴斯说：“以色列是一个高于法律的国家。” “它已经将占领从根据国际法的暂时状况转变为永久定居点殖民化的局面，并强加了一种单一国家的种族隔离现实。”">"Israel is acting as a state above the law," Abbas said. "It has transformed the occupation from a temporary situation as per international law into a situation of permanent settlement colonisation and imposed a one-state reality of apartheid."</p>

<p _translation="半岛电视台外交记者詹姆斯海斯在联合国纽约总部发表讲话时说，巴勒斯坦权力机构对美国政府的调解能力失去信心。">Speaking from the UN headquarters in New York, Al Jazeera's diplomatic correspondent James Bays said the Palestinian Authority has lost faith in the US government's ability to mediate.</p>
<p _translation="“巴勒斯坦人已经给了特朗普政府一年的时间和白宫顾问和特朗普的女婿Jared Kushner的努力，他们认为事情会严重倒退，而不是转发。”海湾说。">"The Palestinians have given a year of the Trump administration and the efforts by [White House adviser and Trump's son-on-law] Jared Kushner, and they believe that things are going seriously backwards not forwards," Bays said.</p>
<p _translation="“现在他们希望看到安理会成员倾听他们的意见，他们表示需要有一种新的方式来提出某种和平解决办法，一种新的格式。”">"Now they want to see the members of the <span>Security Council</span> listen to them when they say there needs to be a new way of coming up with some sort of peace settlement, a new format."</p>
<p _translation="在美国决定将其大使馆从特拉维夫迁往耶路撒冷之后，巴勒斯坦权力机构一直面临压力，因为巴勒斯坦人和哈马斯等竞争对手在过去25年与以色列进行谈判时遭到批评。">The PA has been under pressure in the aftermath of the US decision to relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, after facing criticism from Palestinians and rival factions such as Hamas for engaging in negotiations with Israel during the past 25 years.</p>

<p _translation="“这就是为什么阿巴斯今天正在与联合国安理会谈判，试图提出一种与以色列人达成调解的新方式的想法，”史密斯说。">"This is why Abbas is speaking to the UN <span>Security Council</span> today, to try to advance some sort of idea of a new way of achieving mediation with the Israelis," Smith said.</p>
<p _translation="诚实的经纪人？"><span>Honest broker?</span></p>
<p _translation="华盛顿特区政治分析家穆罕默德·奥维斯告诉半岛电视台，由于以色列和美国的联合国大使“决心破坏任何有利于巴勒斯坦人民权利的事情”，任何未来的会议都已经是“失败”。">Mohammad Oweis, a political analyst based in Washington DC, told Al Jazeera any future conference is already a "failure" as the Israeli and American UN ambassadors are "determined to derail anything that serves the rights of the Palestinian people".</p>
<p _translation="“巴勒斯坦人和以色列人无法参加和谈，因为谈判是由特朗普政府的极端法西斯支持右翼支持以色列和对巴勒斯坦人的敌意来预先判断的，”他补充说，“没有人”可以填补诚实经纪人的角色。">"There is no way for Palestinians and Israelis to sit for peace talks because the negotiations are prejudged by [the Trump's administration's] extreme fascist right-wing support to Israel and animosity against Palestinians," he said, adding there is "nobody" that can fill the role of an honest broker.</p>
<p _translation="虽然俄罗斯联合国大使瓦西里内内齐亚告诉安理会，他的国家“准备为没有先决条件的以色列人和巴勒斯坦人提供一个平台”，但奥维斯驳回了俄罗斯在中东和平进程中可能发挥的作用。">Although Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council his country is "ready to provide a platform for Israelis and Palestinians without pre-conditions", Oweis dismissed any potential role for Russia in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p _translation="“一切[Nebenzia说]是笼统地说，”他说。“我不认为俄罗斯可以采取任何立场，因为它在中东地区忙于自己的失败。”">"Everything [Nebenzia said] was in general terms," he said. "I don't think Russia can take any position because it is busy with its own fiascos in the Middle East."</p>

<p _translation="“你是问题的一部分，而不是解决方案，”Danon对Abbas说。">"You are part of the problem, not the solution," Danon said, addressing Abbas.</p>
<p _translation="就她而言，美国驻联合国大使Nikki Haley利用她的平台解散了联合国机构，称它在讨论以色列 - 巴勒斯坦问题上花费了“不成比例的时间”。">For her part, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, used her platform to dismiss the UN body, saying it spends a "disproportionate amount of time" discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue.</p>
<p _translation="“这并不是说这些问题并不重要，”她说。“问题在于，联合国一再证明自己在涉及以色列时是一个严重偏倚的组织。">"It's not that these issues are not important," she said. "The problem is that the UN has proven itself time and again to be a grossly biased organisation when it comes to Israel.</p>
<p _translation="“因此，联合国过分关注实际上使问题更难以通过提升双方之间的紧张关系和不满情绪来解决。”">"As such the UN's disproportionate focus has actually made the problem more difficult to solve by elevating the tensions and grievances between the two parties."</p>
<p _translation="与库什纳和中东特使贾森格林布拉特会面的哈利也呼吁阿巴斯避开美国承认耶路撒冷为以色列首都的立场，告诉他这一决定不会改变。">Haley, who arrived at the meeting with Kushner and Middle East Envoy Jason Greenblatt, also called on Abbas to get past his rejection of the US' stance to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, telling him that decision will not change.</p>
<p _translation="“你可以选择谴责美国，拒绝美国在和平谈判中的作用，并在联合国等国际论坛上对以色列采取惩罚性措施，”海利说。">"You can choose to denounce the US, reject the US role in peace talks and pursue punitive measures against Israel in international forums like the UN," Haley said.</p>
<p _translation="“或者你可以选择把愤怒放在我们大使馆的位置，并与我们一起走向谈判妥协，这有可能改善巴勒斯坦人民的生活。”">"Or you can choose to put aside your anger at the location of our embassy and move forward with us towards a negotiated compromise that holds great potential for improving the lives of Palestinian people."</p>
<p _translation="海湾强调了这次会议的“戏剧和戏剧”与他形容为“非常令人沮丧”的现实。">Bays highlighted the meeting's "drama and theatrics" with the reality he described as "very depressing".</p>
<p _translation="“我必须说，安全理事会没有真正取得任何进展，这使我们更接近解决70多年来发生的冲突，”他说。">"I have to say that nothing really has been achieved in the <span>Security Council</span> that brings us any closer to a resolution of a conflict that has gone on now for more than 70 years," he said.</p></div></div>
