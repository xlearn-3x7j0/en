<p _translation="据报道，西班牙法院已决定不针对上周在巴塞罗那偷窃出租车的四名西布朗球员的案件。">A Spanish court has decided not to pursue a case against the four West Brom players who allegedly stole a taxi in Barcelona last week, according to reports.</p>
<p _translation="Jonny Evans，Gareth Barry，Jake Livermore和Boaz Myhill参加了一次事件，俱乐部正在参加温暖的天气训练营和团队练习。">Jonny Evans, Gareth Barry, Jake Livermore and Boaz Myhill were involved in an incident while the club was away on a warm-weather training camp and team-bonding exercise.</p>
<p _translation="当时他们接受了当地警方的采访，但是由于没有足够的证据可以继续处理这起案件，这个四人组似乎已经摆脱了惩罚，据报道，这个案件已经被暂时驳回，但如果有新的证据可以重新开庭。">They were interviewed by local police at the time, but the quartet appear set to escape punishment because there is insufficient evidence to continue with the case, which, reports say, has been provisionally dismissed but could be reopened if new evidence comes to light.</p>
<p _translation="新闻协会运动联系时，西布朗无法发表评论。">West Brom were unavailable for comment when contacted by Press Association Sport.</p>

<p _translation="这四名球员周五在集体声明中为打破宵禁道歉，但西布朗队主教练帕里德表示，他对这起事件感到“愤怒”。">The four players apologised for breaking a curfew in a collective statement on Friday, but West Brom manager Alan Pardew has said he was left “furious” by the incident.</p>
<p _translation="巴塞罗那赛事增加了Pardew的热度，Pardew在球场动荡和球场效果不佳的情况下一直是投机的主题。">Events in Barcelona increased the heat on Pardew, whose position has been the subject of speculation in the wake of boardroom upheaval and poor results on the pitch.</p>
<p _translation="星期六，帕杜在他的首发阵容中将埃文斯和巴里命名为英格兰足总杯第三轮南安普顿在山楂球队的失利，尽管埃文斯被剥夺了队长的职务。">Pardew named both Evans and Barry in his starting line-up for the FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Southampton at The Hawthorns on Saturday, although Evans was stripped of the captaincy.</p>
<div>

<p _translation="西布朗主教练阿兰帕杜一直无法带领俱乐部摆脱危险（Nick Potts / PA）。">West Brom manager Alan Pardew has been unable to lead the club away from danger (Nick Potts/PA).</p>
</div>
<p _translation="Pardew本周将决定是否将臂章交给前曼联后卫或永久移除。">Pardew is set to decide this week whether to give the armband back to the former Manchester United defender or permanently remove it.</p>
<p _translation="自从Pardew在11月底开始控球以来，西布朗在所有比赛中只赢得17场比赛中的3场，并且在英超联赛中排名第17位，落后于哈德斯菲尔德排名第17位，他们在周末的比赛中主场作战。">Since Pardew took charge towards the end of November, West Brom have won just three of 17 matches in all competitions and are bottom of the Premier League, seven points adrift of 17th-placed Huddersfield, whom they host in a crucial clash at the weekend.</p>
<p _translation="上周Pardew的位置被削弱，而在巴塞罗那，有消息称中国老板赖国川已经解雇了董事长约翰威廉姆斯和首席执行官马丁古德曼，他们都有助于任命这位56岁的老将。">Pardew’s position was weakened last week while in Barcelona with the news that Chinese owner Guochuan Lai had sacked chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodman, who were both instrumental in appointing the 56-year-old.</p></div>
