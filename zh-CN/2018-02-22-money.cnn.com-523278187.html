In a statement, YouTube said its system "misclassified" the video because it featured footage from a reputable news broadcast. </p> <p _translation=" “这个视频不应该出现在趋势中”，一位YouTube发言人在向CNN发表的一份声明中表示，该声明以熟悉的语言结束：“我们正在努力改进我们的系统。” "> "This video should never have appeared in Trending," a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN, which concluded with a familiar line: "We are working to improve our systems moving forward." </p> <p _translation="在Facebook  （FB）上，Hogg周三成为用户的热门话题。但是他的名字中的几个最重要的结果显示了霍格作为有偿演员的类似理论。（霍格本人已经驳斥了这些说法。）"> On <span>Facebook</span> <span>(<span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FB&amp;source=story_quote_link">FB</a></span>)</span>, Hogg was a trending topic for users Wednesday. But <a href="https://twitter.com/selenalarson/status/966340622687678466" target="_blank">several of the top results</a> for his name showed similar theories about Hogg being a paid actor. (Hogg, for his part, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/david-hogg-conspiracy-theories-response/index.html">knocked down</a> these claims.) </p> <p _translation=" Facebook内容政策负责人Mary deBree在一份声明中称这些帖子“令人反感”，并表示Facebook正在删除该内容。 "> Mary deBree, Facebook's head of content policy, called the posts "abhorrent" in a statement and said Facebook was removing the content. </p> <p _translation=" 相关：YouTube更改搜索以对抗拉斯维加斯的阴谋视频 "> <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/technology/culture/youtube-conspiracy/index.html">Related: YouTube changes search to combat Las Vegas conspiracy videos</a> </p> <p _translation="在美国人的生活中，阴谋论理论并不新鲜。但是，技术平台的潜力可以增强这些理论的影响力，这是现代社会独有的社会威胁。"> Conspiracy theories are not new, certainly in American life. But the potential for tech platforms to supercharge the reach of these theories is a societal threat unique to the modern era. </p> <p _translation=" 在这个问题上，宏伟的承诺和赎罪的这种熟悉的循环说明了更深层次的担忧，即科技公司是否有能力或愿意充分地警惕自己的大型平台。 "> This familiar cycle of grandiose promises and atonement on this issue speaks to deeper concerns about whether tech companies are able, or willing, to adequately police their own massive platforms. </p> <p _translation="仅在最后一周，Google就被要求对黑人文化和贫穷的搜索结果提出攻击性建议，并且在联邦起诉书中提到了一些关于俄罗斯大选干涉的大型科技公司。"> In the last week alone, Google has been <a href="https://twitter.com/d1gi/status/966399245254316038" target="_blank">called out</a> for making offensive suggestions for search results about black culture and poverty, and several big tech companies have been mentioned in a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/16/media/internet-research-agency-mueller-indictment/index.html">federal indictment about Russian election meddling</a>. </p> <p _translation=" 要使用硅谷的首选说法，现在很难摆脱这样的结论：传播错误信息和恶作剧是社交媒体平台的一个特点，而不是缺陷，以及它们的商业模式。 "> To use Silicon Valley's preferred parlance, it's now hard to escape the conclusion that the spreading of misinformation and hoaxes is a feature, not a bug, of social media platforms -- and their business models. </p> <p _translation="Facebook和Google通过提供他们不支付或审查数十亿用户的内容来制作令人难以置信的有利可图的业务，并针对该内容投放广告。这些平台的开发目标越来越好，以促进他们的广告业务，但不一定更好的内容缓和，以鼓励用户的话语。"> Facebook and Google built incredibly profitable businesses by serving content they don't pay for or vet to billions of users, with ads placed against that content. The platforms developed better and better targeting to buoy their ad businesses, but not necessarily better content moderation to buoy user discourse. </p> <p _translation="在最近几个月监管机构和广告商的压力下，两家公司最终承诺雇用数千名额外的员工来调整他们的平台。Facebook首席执行官兼联合创始人马克扎克伯格在11月告诉投资者，此举可能会削减该公司的利润率。"> Under pressure from regulators and advertisers in recent months, the two companies have finally pledged to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/05/technology/google-youtube-hiring-reviewers-offensive-videos/index.html">hire thousands of additional workers</a> to moderate their platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO and co-founder, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/technology/business/facebook-earnings/index.html">told investors</a> in November the move could cut into the company's profit margins. </p> <p _translation=" 但即便如此，与需求相比，这可能会是一个下降。 "> But even this could prove to be a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed. </p> <figure> <img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180221140648-facebook-youtube-parkland-conspiracies-780x439.jpg" width="780" height="439" alt="facebook youtube parkland conspiracies"> </figure>  <p _translation="Facebook已经表示，预计到今年年底，将有2万人从事安全和安全问题的工作。拥有21亿用户，相当于每10万人有一名警察巡逻。"> Facebook has said it expects to have 20,000 people working on safety and security issues by the end of this year. With 2.1 billion users, that is the equivalent of having one cop on patrol for every 100,000 citizens. </p> <p _translation="Facebook的前产品经理Antonio Garcia Martinez在帮助开发其广告定位系统时说：“人们高估了Facebook的资源并低估了Facebook的处理量。” “Facebook每天都要经历几十亿个帖子（照片，文字，签到等）。”"> "People overestimate Facebook's resources and underestimate just how much content Facebook handles," Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager at Facebook who helped develop its ad targeting system, said in an email. "Facebook has to go through literally billions of posts (photos, text, check-ins, etc.) a day." </p> <p _translation="因此，他说，Facebook“根本无法手动审查每一个新闻帖子。” 公司通常最终依靠用户标记可疑内容。马丁内斯说，这可能会造成“时间滞后”，才会引起Facebook员工的注意。"> As a result, he says, Facebook "simply cannot manually review each and every news post." The company often ends up relying on its users to flag questionable content. Martinez says this can create a "time lag" before it gets the attention of Facebook staff. </p> <p _translation="谷歌面临类似的问题。即使在招聘时，YouTube也没有人员策划哪些视频出现在其趋势列表中，因为它有很多趋势标签在世界各地不断更新。"> Google faces a similar problem. Even as it ramps up hiring, YouTube does not have humans curating which videos appear in its trending lists because it has so many trending tabs being constantly updated all over the world. </p> <p _translation=" 与科技行业的许多事情一样，首选的解决方案是更多的技术，这使得公司能够继续以大规模运营，这使得它们成为投资者和广告商的有吸引力的主张。 "> As with so many things in the tech industry, the preferred solution is more technology, which allows the companies to keep operating at the massive scale that makes them attractive propositions to investors and advertisers. </p> <p _translation="Facebook和谷歌都在投资人工智能解决方案来清理平台。人工智能可以让这些公司更好地监控他们的平台，而不必雇用数十万工人。"> Both Facebook and Google are investing in artificial intelligence solutions to clean up their platforms. AI may allow the companies to better police their platforms without having to hire hundreds of thousands of workers. </p> <p _translation="但如果这种万灵药到来，它将会在遥远的将来。扎克伯格曾表示，“完全开发这些系统需要很多年”。与此同时，新的阴谋论正在等待趋势。"> But if this kind of panacea arrives at all, it will be in a distant future. Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634/" target="_blank">has said</a> it will take "many years to fully develop these systems." In the meantime, new conspiracy theories are waiting to trend. </p>   <p _translation=" CNNMoney（纽约） 2018年2月21日首次公布：美国东部时间下午6:07 "> <span> CNNMoney (New York) </span> <span>First published February 21, 2018: 6:07 PM ET</span> </p> </div></div>
