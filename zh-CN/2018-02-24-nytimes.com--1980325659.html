The committee, known as Cfius, plays an advisory role to the president, but it can effectively block foreign acquisitions of American companies over national security concerns.</p><p data-para-count="318" data-total-count="1288" _translation="Tacelli先生说：“尽管我们尽最大努力来获得批准，但显然Cfius不会清除这笔交易。” 这笔交易最终将由中国集成电路产业投资基金提供资金，中国集成电路产业投资基金是一个价值210亿美元的基金，将数家中国国营公司列为投资者。">“Despite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that Cfius will not clear this transaction,” Mr. Tacelli said. The deal would ultimately have been financed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, a $21 billion fund that counts several Chinese state-run companies as investors.</p>

Under President Barack Obama, regulators showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/dealbook/china-aixtron-obama-cfius.html">increased skepticism</a> about Chinese deals involving technology companies.
