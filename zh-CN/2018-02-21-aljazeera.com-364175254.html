<p _translation="但周一晚间，市政府表示，由于选民投票率低，投票无效。">But late Monday evening, the municipal government said the vote was invalid because of low voter turnout.</p>
<p _translation="“所有的垃圾，呕吐物，在这里都变得无法活动，”发现酒吧的第七区的一位老年人居住在萨基里的Judit最近2月份的一个早晨告诉半岛电视台。">"All of the rubbish, the vomit, it's become unliveable here," Judit Sakali, an elderly resident of the seventh district where the bars are found, told Al Jazeera on a recent February morning.</p>
<p _translation="Sakali表示，她希望酒吧和餐馆在午夜关闭，以便能够入睡。喧闹的游客阻止她这样做。">Sakali said she wanted bars and restaurants to close at midnight so she could sleep. Noisy tourists have prevented her from doing so.</p>
<p _translation="当地居民称之为“伊丽莎白镇”的居民聚集在一起组成自己的伊丽莎白镇小组，组织自己并记录财产破坏，以应付闹事的聚会者。">Residents in the district, called "Elizabeth Town" by locals, came together to form the Livable Elizabeth Town group to organise themselves and document property destruction in response to rowdy partygoers.</p>
<p _translation="他们经常在街头张贴给游客的笔记：“我们明白，你想过得愉快，但你需要明白......我们的街道不是你的厕所。”">They often post notes addressed to tourists on the streets: "We understand. You want to have a good time, but you need to understand that … our streets are not your toilet."</p>

<p _translation="虽然是地方性的问题，党的地区的命运是4月份选举之前的政治与商业交汇点。">Though a local issue, the party district's fate was the intersection of politics and business in advance of April elections.</p>

<h2 _translation="旅游热潮">Tourism boom</h2>
<p _translation="近年来旅游业猛增，部分原因是匈牙利的预算航班增加以及布达佩斯作为欧洲最美丽城市之一的声誉越来越高。">Tourism has spiked in recent years, partly due to an increase in budget flights to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/hungary.html">Hungary</a> and Budapest's growing reputation as one of Europe's most beautiful cities.</p>

<p _translation="布达佩斯热门地区的许多机构都属于总理Victor Orban的政治盟友，一位匈牙利记者Antonia Radi，他调查了该地区的酒吧所有权，告诉半岛电视台。">Many of the establishments in Budapest's popular district belong to Prime Minister Victor Orban's political allies, Antonia Radi, a Hungarian journalist who investigated bar ownership in the area, told Al Jazeera.</p>

<p _translation="连接不会在那里结束。">The connections don't end there.</p>
<p _translation="长期以来，政府一直批评政府将关键媒体限制在支持政府的网点。">The Fidesz government <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/hungary-alternative-media-fear-radio-silence-20142483619211978.html">has long been criticised</a> for limiting critical media in favour of pro-government outlets.</p>

Istvan Bajkai, the Orban family's lawyer, is vice mayor and a parliamentary candidate in Hungary's April elections. </p><p _translation="  但是，Fidesz在区议会中没有多数票。Janos Stummer是民粹主义者Jobbik党的成员，许多人认为这是极右派，通常担任决定议题的摇摆式投票。">  However, Fidesz does not have a majority on the district council. Janos Stummer, a member of the populist Jobbik party many view as far-right, typically serves as the swing vote to decide issues.</p><p _translation=""></p>
<p _translation="Stummer是最初在2017年提出公民投票的政治家，但后来他投票反对，与Vattamany一起。">Stummer is the politician who originally proposed the referendum in 2017, but he later voted against it, siding with Vattamany.</p>
<p _translation="在国家层面上，Jobbik将自己定位为Fidesz的民粹主义替代品，专注于提高匈牙利和东欧工人的工资等等。">On the national level, Jobbik has positioned itself as a populist alternative to Fidesz, focusing on raising wages for Hungarian and Eastern European workers, among other issues.</p>
<p _translation="许多人说，Fidesz 在难民和移民问题上走得更远，并采取了针对匈牙利美国自由慈善家乔治索罗斯的运动，他为该地区的民间社会组织提供资金。">Many say Fidesz has gone <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/milo-yiannopolous-speak-hungary-funded-v4-event-171229192107531.html">further to the right</a> on issues of refugees and immigration, as well as adopting a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/hungary-campaign-george-soros-171122120334509.html">campaign against</a> Hungarian American liberal philanthropist George Soros, who funds civil society organisations throughout the region.</p>

<p _translation="预计Fidesz将在4月份的选举中赢得议会多数席位，但可能达不到组建自己政府所需的人数。">Fidesz is projected to win a majority of seats in parliament in April elections, but it could fall short of the numbers required to form a government on its own.</p>
<p _translation="民意调查显示Jobbik排在第二位。双方之间的联盟可以想像会组成一个派对。">Polls show Jobbik coming in second. A coalition between the parties could conceivably form a party.</p>
<p _translation="Jobbik成员一再表示，与Fidesz的联盟将不会发生。尽管如此，Vajnai认为它可以。">Jobbik members have repeatedly stated that a coalition with Fidesz won't happen. Still, Vajnai believes it could.</p>
<p _translation="尽管公投被认为是无效的，但Vajnai和宜居伊丽莎白镇的创始人Dori Garai认为它是成功的。">Though the referendum was deemed invalid due to low turnout, both Vajnai and Dori Garai, the founder of Livable Elizabeth Town, saw it as a success.</p>

<p _translation="公民投票后，Vattamany承诺采取措施改善党区居民的生活。">Following the referendum, Vattamany has promised to take measures to improve the lives of party district residents.</p>
<p _translation="Vajnai受到Fidesz市长承诺改善生活条件的鼓舞。">Vajnai was encouraged by the Fidesz mayor's promise to improve living conditions.</p>
<p _translation="在他看来，一些人组织起来挑战Fidesz，他们做出了让步。Vajnai说，这在选举前不久就显示出“大国”。">In his view, a group of people were organised to challenge Fidesz, which made a concession. This shows "big power" shortly before the election, Vajnai said.</p></div></div>
