<p _translation="半岛电视台：作为一个多国联邦的国家，在欧盟的整合和成员资格是否会解决波斯尼亚最棘手的问题，例如它在90年代血腥内战之后沿着民族和种族界限创建的复杂政治体系，以及其经济不稳定？ "><strong>Al Jazeera: As a multi-national federation state, would integration and membership in the EU solve Bosnia's thorniest problems such as its complex political system that was created along national and ethnic lines in the aftermath of the bloody civil war during the '90s, and its economic instability? </strong></p>
<p _translation="考虑到像希腊这样的国家，这个国家尽管是欧盟成员，但却经济不稳定。"><strong>This, considering that countries like Greece for example, suffers from deep economic instability despite being an EU member.</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：当我们成为欧盟成员时，两个关键问题将得到解决："><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: When we become members of the EU, two key issues will be resolved:</p>
<p _translation="第一，通过解决与巴尔干西部边界有关的问题来实现安全和稳定。欧盟委员会强调，巴尔干西部，波斯尼亚，塞尔维亚，克罗地亚，黑山和科索沃等六个国家必须解决边界争端，然后才能升格为全面的欧盟成员国。">One - it will accomplish security and stability by resolving the issues related to the borders in the western Balkans. The EU commission has emphasized that the six countries in the western Balkans, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia Montenegro and Kosovo must resolve their border disputes before ascending to full EU membership.</p>

<p _translation="两个 - 欧盟和北约成员国将导致经济繁荣。希腊遭受经济问题，因为它没有实施推荐的欧盟经济措施，这将有助于摆脱经济衰退。">Two - the EU and NATO membership will result in economic prosperity. Greece suffers economic problems because it did not implement the recommended EU economic measures that would have helped it out of its economic slump.</p>
<p _translation="但以罗马尼亚，保加利亚和斯洛文尼亚等国家为例，它们是遵循欧盟措施和标准的东欧国家的典型例子，尽管最初对人口造成了严重的影响，但从长远来看，它最终会变得更好，更加繁荣。">But take for example countries like Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia which are good examples of East European countries that followed the EU measures and standards and that despite the initial painful impact on the population, it ended up better off and more prosperous in the long run.</p>
<p _translation="半岛电视台：波斯尼亚大选将于今年10月举行，这是否解释了来自该国不同国家群体的民族主义言论的兴起，你打算竞选总统吗？"><strong>Al Jazeera: The general elections in Bosnia are slated to take place this October, does that explain the rise of nationalistic rhetoric from the different national groups in the country and are you planning to run for president?</strong></p>
<p _translation="兹维兹迪奇：至于竞选总统，也许我会说，我可能会竞选总统，届时我们会看到会发生什么。"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: As for as running for president, I would say maybe, I might run for president, we will see what happens when the time comes.</p>
<p _translation="至于问题的另一部分，自从选举以来，所有群体的言辞崛起并不罕见。这已成为波黑选举政治中的典型代表。然而，一旦选举结束，言辞平息，政治平衡和对现实的回归就会持续下去。">As for the other part of the question, since its election season, it is not unusual to see the rise of rhetoric from all groups. This has become typical in Bosnian electoral politics. However, once the election is over, the rhetoric subsides and a political balance and a return to reality takes hold.</p>

<p _translation="半岛电视台：波斯尼亚有民主希望吗？该地区的其他国家似乎已经开始好转，为什么波斯尼亚没有？"><strong>Al Jazeera: Is there hope for democracy in Bosnia? Other countries in the region have seemingly moved on and became better off, why hasn’t Bosnia?</strong></p>
<p _translation="Zvizdic：我不同意在这方面评估其他巴尔干国家比波斯尼亚好。我们的地区经历了共产主义和专制政权太久。向民主过渡需要时间，需要改变思想，文化和价值观。"><strong>Zvizdic</strong>: I disagree with the assessment that other Balkan countries are better off than Bosnia in that respect. Our region has lived through communism and authoritarian regimes for too long. The transition to democracy takes time and it requires a change in thinking, culture and values.</p>
<p _translation="民主和自由市场经济的原则必须为我们地区所接受。但是，渐渐地，我们正朝着这个方向前进。">The principles of democracy and free market economy must be accepted by our region. Gradually, however, we are heading in that direction.</p>
