Though it still could face procedural obstacles, it has the support of a rare alliance of the Conservative government, the leadership of the opposition Labour Party, and the British medical establishment, indicating that chances of passage are good.</p><p data-para-count="240" data-total-count="910" _translation="“我很少看到如此一致的支持范围，”担任该法案的劳工立法者杰弗里罗宾逊说，他是周五发表赞成意见的两个主要政党中的几十个人之一。“这将拯救生命。”">“I’ve seldom seen such a unanimous range of support,” said Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour lawmaker who sponsored the bill and who was one of dozens from both major parties who spoke in favor of it on Friday. “This will save lives.”</p><p data-para-count="218" data-total-count="1128" _translation="这一变化将适用于英格兰。苏格兰议会也在考虑转向选择退出制度，而北爱尔兰则需要明确的同意。自2015年以来，威尔斯已经推测同意捐赠器官。">The change would apply in England. The Scottish Parliament is also considering moving to an opt-out system, while Northern Ireland requires explicit consent. Wales has had presumed consent to organ donation since 2015.</p>

Though some of those rules have been in place for decades, most have been adopted in recent years; an opt-out system took effect in France last year, and the Dutch Parliament approved one this month.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>
