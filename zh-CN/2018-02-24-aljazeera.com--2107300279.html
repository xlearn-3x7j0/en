Four people, including President <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/profile-president-donald-trump-161109050153947.html">Donald Trump</a>'s foreign campaign manager, have also been indicted, leading some to question if more figures from the Trump administration - or even the president himself - will be implicated.</span></p>
<p _translation="“特朗普的行为使他处于可能被勒索的位置，”前中央情报局驻莫斯科的前总监约翰·西佩尔说，他补充说，俄罗斯有“世界上最好的勒索服务”。">"Mr Trump's behaviour puts him in a position where he could be blackmailed," says John Sipher, a former CIA station chief in Moscow, adding that Russia has "the best service in the world at blackmail".</p>
<p _translation="然而，在他担任总统一年后，没有确凿证据表明特朗普提出与俄罗斯勾结。&nbsp;">However, one year into his presidency, no hard evidence has emerged against Trump to suggest collusion with <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="“这些是间谍组织，间谍活动，”Sipher说。“他们的意图是保密的......证据的标准非常高，但是，我们在政治上不良行为，不道德行为以及不爱国行为方面所见的标准已经得到满足。”">"These are espionage organisations, espionage activities," says Sipher. "They're meant to be kept secret ... The bar for evidence is very high. However, the bar for what we've seen in terms of politically bad behaviour, and unethical behaviour, and unpatriotic behaviour has been met."</p>
<p _translation="在对中央情报局在世界各地进行干预时的行为，包括推翻伊朗，&nbsp; 智利 &nbsp;和&nbsp; 海地政府的行为提出&nbsp; 质疑时，Sipher表示，尽管采取了这些行动，但中央情报局的制衡与平衡使该组织与俄罗斯情报服务。">When pressed on the behaviour of the CIA during their interventions around the world, including the toppling of governments in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/chile.html">Chile</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/haiti.html">Haiti</a>, Sipher says that, despite these actions, the checks and balances placed on the CIA set the organisation apart from Russian intelligence services.</p>
<p _translation="“我承认是错误，美国总统推动中央情报局参与进来，”他说。">"I will admit were mistakes, that presidents of the United States pushed the CIA to get involved in," he says.</p>
<p _translation="“但是，这里有一个制度，这些人正在代表宪法工作，有国会监督，有总统，白宫和参与这些事情的人的建议和同意。">"However, there's a system here by which those people are working on behalf of the Constitution, there's congressional oversight, there's advice and consent to the president and to the White House and people involved with these things.</p>
<p _translation="“在俄罗斯，这些服务正在代表一个男人，这个单身男人为他们做出这些决定。”">"In Russia, those services are working on behalf of a single man. That single man makes those decisions for them."</p>
