On March 11, Cuba will hold elections for the National Assembly, which in turn will select the country’s next president on April 19. President Raúl Castro, brother of the late Fidel Castro, will not run for re-election. In 2012, he introduced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/world/americas/17cuba.html">term limits</a> and seems willing to honor them. The National Assembly is widely expected to choose a successor from outside the Castro family.</p><p data-para-count="217" data-total-count="703" _translation="我们对这次继承有什么看法？一个乐观的解读是，这可能是走向民主的第一步。一个更现实的解读是，古巴正走向更多同样的道路：不民主的一党统治。">What are we to make of this succession? One optimistic reading is that this could be the first step toward democracy. A more realistic reading is that Cuba is heading for more of the same: undemocratic one-party rule.</p><p data-para-count="256" data-total-count="959" _translation="如果古巴共产党 - 允许参加一党政权下的选举的唯一一方 - 很聪明，那么在获得好的时候，它会试图脱身。通过按照自己的条件向民主过渡，党可以从中受益。">If the Cuban Communist Party — the only party allowed to participate in elections under the one-party regime — were smart, it would try to get out while the getting is good. By transitioning to democracy on its own terms, the party could reap benefits.</p><p data-para-count="270" data-total-count="1229" _translation="新配置的机构和法律（例如选举法）可以根据其优势量身定制。党可以利用卡斯特罗的这种新自由为古巴人创造新的自由，从而产生可以转化为选票的良好意愿。">Newly configured institutions and laws (for example, electoral laws) could be tailor-made to its advantage. The party could take advantage of this new freedom from the Castros to produce new freedoms for Cubans, thus generating good will that could translate into votes.</p>
<p data-para-count="392" data-total-count="1621" id="story-continues-1" _translation="毕竟，在许多新民主国家中，旧的专制执政党（或前独裁者组成的政党）仍然是着名的演员。在大多数情况下，这些“ 专制的继承党 ”可以自由公平地选举回任。从墨西哥到蒙古，波兰到巴拿马，西班牙到韩国，台湾到突尼斯，选民都回到了“坏人”掌权。">After all, in many new democracies, the old authoritarian ruling parties (or parties formed by former authoritarians) remain prominent actors. In a majority of cases, these “<a href="https://kellogg.nd.edu/sites/default/files/old_files/documents/411.pdf">authoritarian successor parties</a>” are freely and fairly elected back into office.

And some authoritarian regimes can point to significant achievements. In the case of Cuba, the party could point to its record in the areas of free public services like health care, nationalism and <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/26/cuba-fidel-castro-was-hell/">domestic security</a>.</p><p data-para-count="172" data-total-count="2134" _translation="但共产党等待的时间越长，这种退出策略就越不可行 - 而且党最终会屈服于全面政权崩溃的可能性越大。">But the longer the Communists wait, the less viable this exit strategy becomes — and the more likely that the party will eventually succumb to full-blown regime collapse.</p><p data-para-count="377" data-total-count="2511" _translation="像古巴这样的革命产生的独裁政权往往能够存活数十年，但是一旦革命的一代人死亡，尤其是如果他们无法找到其他合法性来源，比如中国近几十年的非凡经济增长，他们就会奋斗。出于这个原因，这个“金色降落伞”选项应该吸引古巴的统治者。">Authoritarian regimes born of revolutions such as Cuba’s often survive for decades, but <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/durability-revolutionary-regimes">they struggle once the revolutionary generation dies off</a> — especially if they cannot find an alternative source of legitimacy, such as China’s extraordinary economic growth in recent decades. For this reason, this “golden parachute” option should be appealing to Cuba’s rulers.</p><p data-para-count="415" data-total-count="2926" _translation="对古巴人民不幸的是，很少有迹象表明这种选择正在被考虑。相反，大多数迹象表明继续保持现状 - 继承非卡斯特罗，是的，但不是向更自由的政权过渡。古巴政权依然受到保护，免于国内压力变得更加民主，即使最终这样做是古巴共产党的长远利益。">Unfortunately for the Cuban people, there are few signs that this option is being considered. Instead, most signs point to a continuation of the status quo — a succession to a non-Castro, yes, but not a transition to a freer regime. The Cuban regime remains fairly protected from domestic pressures to become more democratic, even if it is ultimately in the Cuban Communist Party’s long-term interests to do so.</p><p data-para-count="352" data-total-count="3278" _translation="最明显的是，虽然卡斯特罗先生将辞去总统职务，但他不会完全退休。他将继续担任共产党的首脑，也是该国最重要的两个机构 - 军方的非官方首脑。当前独裁统治者保留对国家关键部分的控制权时，他们能够否决任何潜在的民主开放。">Most obviously, while Mr. Castro will step down as president, he will not retire fully. He will remain head of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/raul-castro-re-elected-to-top-post-in-cubas-communist-party-1461092340">Communist Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article134121954.html">unofficial head of the military</a>, the country’s two most important institutions.

<p data-para-count="547" data-total-count="3825" _translation="卡斯特罗先生的儿子和女儿也将保持强大的地位。他的儿子亚历杭德罗经营内政部，他的女儿玛丽拉是国民议会成员，也是古巴最重要的性别智囊团Cenesex的负责人。亚历杭德罗以对效率的热爱而着称，Mariela因为对LGBT事业的热爱而闻名。但对于对自由主义政治的热爱都不为人所知。他们两人的大部分时间压抑（在Alejandro的情况下）和贬低（在Mariela的情况下）持异议者。">Mr. Castro’s son and daughter will remain in powerful positions, as well. His son, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-castro/a-castro-son-rises-in-cuba-idUSKBN0OX1SU20150617">Alejandro</a>, runs the Ministry of the Interior, and his daughter, <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/05/26/lgbt-advocate-challenges-cuban-human-rights-record/">Mariela</a>, is a member of the National Assembly and the head of Cuba’s most important gender think tank, Cenesex. Alejandro is known for his love for efficiency, and Mariela for her love for L.G.B.T. causes. But neither is known for a love of liberal politics. The two devote a significant part of their time repressing (in the case of Alejandro) and belittling (in the case of Mariela) dissenters.</p><p data-para-count="627" data-total-count="4452" _translation="除了家庭本身，劳尔·卡斯特罗最重要的政策遗产 - 对经济的军事控制 - 很难被驱散。古巴军方通过其集团Gaesa拥有绝大多数从事贸易业务的公司，从酒店到外汇交易所到港口，这使得它可以控制多达60％的硬通货。任何经济改革者都知道，打破垄断是困难的，如果垄断者也掌握着武器和智力的话更是如此。古巴的军队不仅承诺一党一党的统治，而且承诺一个企业的经济。">Beyond the family itself is the fact that Raúl Castro’s most important policy legacy — military control of the economy — is hard to dislodge. The Cuban military, through its conglomerate Gaesa, owns the vast majority of firms that operate engaged in trade, from hotels to foreign exchange houses to ports, which gives it control of up to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba-military/cuban-militarys-tentacles-reach-deep-into-economy-idUSKBN1962VK">60 percent of incoming hard currency</a>. Any economic reformer knows that breaking a monopoly is difficult, even more so if the monopolist also holds power over arms and intelligence. Cuba’s military is committed to not just one-party rule, but also, it seems, to one-firm economics.</p><p data-para-count="644" data-total-count="5096" _translation="而且由于古巴的经济如此封闭，私营部门又小又薄弱。我们知道，向民主过渡要求有财富的演员游说国家进行改革 - 也许会资助反对派。在菲德尔卡斯特罗的领导下，古巴实施了世界上最严厉的私人财产禁令之一，基本上阻止了这种可能性的发生。他的兄弟确实扩大了允许的自营职业活动的数量，但只有需要低技能的职业才被放开; 雇用和融资方面的巨大限制依然存在，税收负担很重。私营部门存在，但受到严重阻碍。">And because Cuba’s economy is so closed, the private sector is small and weak. We know that transitions to democracy require actors with wealth to lobby the state for change — and perhaps bankroll the opposition. Under Fidel Castro, Cuba enforced one of the world’s most draconian bans on private property, essentially foreclosing the possibility of this occurring. His brother did expand the number of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/open-for-business/">allowable self-employed activities</a>, but only professions requiring low skills were liberalized; huge restrictions on hiring and financing remain in place, and taxation is onerous. The private sector exists, but it is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-exclusive/exclusive-cuban-draft-rules-propose-curtailing-fledgling-private-sector-idUSKCN1G700I">severely hampered</a>.</p>

One would think that remittances could help democracy in Cuba by financing civil society. But because poverty is rampant and financing scarce, most remittances get used for <a href="http://www.cubatrademagazine.com/pipeline-private-sector/"> household consumption or self-employment activities</a>, with very little left over for the sorts of civic groups that are indispensable for democracy to emerge.</p><p data-para-count="233" data-total-count="6280" _translation="继承之后，古巴的政权将继续受到卡斯特罗家族，军方以及旨在限制商业和政治组织发展的监管体系的影响，从而最大限度地减少民主化的压力。">After the succession, Cuba’s regime will remain cornered by the Castro family, the military and by a regulatory system designed to restrict the growth of business and political organizations, minimizing the pressure to democratize.</p><p data-para-count="398" data-total-count="6678" _translation="也许在继承后更大民主的唯一可能的压力可能来自党和军队之间的冲突。这些都是独立的实体，每个实体都有自己的文化，资源和支持基础。可以想象，党和军方之间最终发生的冲突可能会产生政治地震，这在理论上可能会产生政治过渡。">Perhaps the only possible pressure for greater democracy after the succession could come from a conflict between the party and the military. These are separate entities, each with its own culture, resources and base of support. It is conceivable that an eventual conflict between the party and the military could produce a political earthquake, which could in theory produce a political transition.</p><p data-para-count="199" data-total-count="6877" _translation="卡斯特罗先生比古巴人更了解这一点。这就是为什么他可能会决定继续负责这两个集团，只要情况如此，自由古巴的潜力仍然有限。">Mr. Castro understands this better than anyone in Cuba.
