In the interest of fairness, justice and a military that represents American diversity, he should seize it.</p><p data-para-count="212" data-total-count="838" _translation="美国跨性别人士在军方中获得平等捍卫自己国家的权利仅一年之后，特朗普在去年7月发布的一系列推文中，总算表示他将放弃他们的服务。">It was only a year after transgender Americans secured the right to defend their nation as equals in the military that Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets last July, summarily said he would banish them from serving.</p><p data-para-count="473" data-total-count="1311" _translation="这位总统以五次推迟的方式躲避越南战争，似乎贬低了跨性别者的参与，因为他们无理地断言军队“必须专注于决定性的和压倒性的胜利”。自那时以来，许多人都为了防御包括两名共和党参议员，亚利桑那州的约翰麦凯恩，以前的战俘和犹他州的奥林海奇，还有56名退休将军和海军上将。">The president, who dodged the Vietnam War with five deferments, seemed to disparage the transgender enlistees as unsuited for battle by gratuitously asserting that the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.” Since then, many have rallied to the defense of the transgender troops, including two senior Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, who is a former P.O.W., and Orrin Hatch of Utah, plus a group of 56 retired generals and admirals.</p>
<p data-para-count="372" data-total-count="1683" id="story-continues-1" _translation="去年秋天，参谋长联席会议主席海军陆战队员约瑟夫·邓福德将军告诉参议院军事委员会，跨性别军队已经荣幸地服役。“我相信任何符合身体和心理标准，并且可在全球部署并且目前正在服务的人应该有机会继续服务，”他说。">Last fall, Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. of the Marines, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that transgender troops have served with honor. “I believe any individual who meets the physical and mental standards and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve,” he said.</p>

<p data-para-count="511" data-total-count="3589" _translation="顶级防务官员对特朗普的禁令做出了缓慢的反应。在提起诉讼提起诉讼之后，两名联邦法官去年年底阻止了它的生效，一名法官认为这很可能违宪。她在10月的决定不仅停止了释放所有跨性别军队的计划，而且还允许当前的跨性别军队重新入伍并允许跨性别人员在1月份开始加入军队，这是五角大楼已开始实施的一个过程。">Top defense officials responded to Mr. Trump’s ban by slow-walking it. And after lawsuits were filed challenging the move, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/transgender-ban-military.html">two federal judges late last year</a> blocked it from taking effect, with one judge calling it most likely unconstitutional. Her decision, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html">in October</a>, not only halted a plan to discharge all transgender troops, it also allowed current transgender troops to re-enlist and permitted transgender recruits to join the military starting in January, a process the Pentagon has begun to implement.</p><p data-para-count="442" data-total-count="4031" _translation="尽管这些都是积极的迹象，但仍然存在很多不确定性，包括马蒂斯先生提出的与跨性别人士的待遇以及特朗普是否有能力改变这个问题的方向。现在马蒂斯先生的建议已经到达白宫，将由特朗普先生作出最终决定。如果他坚持自己的偏见，迫使变性人离开军队并回到阴影之下，那将是悲惨的。">While these are positive signs, a lot of uncertainty remains, including what Mr. Mattis proposes to do with transgender recruits and whether Mr. Trump is capable of changing course on this issue. Now that Mr. Mattis’s recommendation has arrived at the White House, it will be up to Mr. Trump to make a final decision. It will be tragic if he clings to his prejudice, forcing transgender people out of the military and back into the shadows.</p>
