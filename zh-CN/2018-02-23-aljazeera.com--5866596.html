<p _translation="一个紧急状态顺序紧随其后宣布，埃塞俄比亚暴跌进一步陷入政治不确定的状态。">A <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-state-emergency-months-180217131703045.html" target="_blank">state of emergency</a> order soon followed the announcement, plunging Ethiopia even further into a state of political uncertainty.</p>
<p _translation="在准备取代海勒马里安成为党的领导人时，执政的埃塞俄比亚人民革命民主阵线（EPRDF）一直在花时间来确定下一步行动，&nbsp;"><span>As it prepares to replace Hailemariam as the head of the party, t</span>he ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been buying time to figure out its next move,&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="在一个执政联盟主席历史上也承担总理职责的国家，围绕着谁可以介入海勒玛里安的问题仍在继续围绕着。">In a country where the chairman of the ruling coalition has historically also taken on prime minister duties, questions continue to swirl around who could step in for Hailemariam.</p>
<p _translation="但任何接班人都将面临艰巨的任务，任命一位新总理可能不足以满足埃塞俄比亚人对更大政治改革的要求。">But any successor will have a difficult task ahead, and appointing a new prime minister will likely not be enough to satisfy Ethiopians' demands for greater political reforms.</p>
<p _translation="Addis标准报的主编Tsedale Lemma表示：“换岗不是人们想要的。”">"A&nbsp;change of guard is not what the people want," said Tsedale Lemma, editor-in-chief of the Addis Standard newspaper.</p>
<p _translation="她解释说，相反，埃塞俄比亚人要求国家治理的方式“根本改变”，这样才能让所有的利益受到聆听和代表。">Instead, Ethiopians are demanding "a fundamental change" in the way the country is governed that would allow all interests to be heard and represented, she explained.</p>
<p _translation="“作为一个国家，这不会有太大的区别，EPRDF是EPRDF，”她说。">"As a country, this is not going to make so much of a difference. EPRDF is EPRDF," she said.</p>
<p _translation="“埃塞俄比亚人民不需要改变警惕，他们需要政府的整体变革 - 一个动态的变化，一个根本性的变化，EPRDF目前的考虑方式。”">"The people of Ethiopia are not requiring a change of guard, they are requiring an overall change of the government - a dynamic change, a fundamental change, [to] the way the EPRDF is considered so far."</p>
<h2 _translation="奥罗莫候选人">Oromo candidates</h2>
<p _translation="哈默森侯赛因是一位作家兼埃塞俄比亚驻美国的分析家，他说，关于谁能够取代海尔马里昂的决定“至关重要”&nbsp; 。">The decision over who will succeed Hailemariam is "vitally important", said&nbsp;Hassen Hussein,&nbsp;a writer and Ethiopia analyst based in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html" target="_blank">United States</a>.</p>
<p _translation="他说，它“可以从悬崖边走出一条狭窄的道路，或者把（埃塞俄比亚）引入它”。">He said it "could either [present] a narrow path away from the precipice, or lead [Ethiopia] right into it".</p>
<p _translation="在他的前任Meles Zenawi于2012年去世后上台的Hailemariam&nbsp; 说，他将继续担任看守首相，直到替补人选被提名。">Hailemariam, who came to power after&nbsp;<span>the death of his predecessor, Meles Zenawi in 2012, </span>said he will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a replacement is named.</p>
<p _translation="但由于“抗议运动的引擎”一直是该国最大的民族国家组织的边缘化，奥罗莫，侯赛因说可能会造成毁灭性的影响。">But since "the engine of the protest movement" has been the marginalisation of the country's largest ethno-national group, the Oromo, Hussein said that could have a devastating effect.</p>
<p _translation="“如果安装另一个[种族]组织的人，我认为人们会将其解释为'呃，你又去了'。这将是似曾相识，“他告诉半岛电视台。">"If somebody from another [ethnic] group is installed, I think people will interpret that as, 'Well, there you go again.' It will be deja vu," he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="&nbsp;自2015年以来，奥罗莫所在地的埃塞俄比亚奥罗米亚地区一直在进行大规模的&nbsp; 反政府抗议活动。">Mass&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-mass-protests-rooted-country-history-180219130441837.html" target="_blank">anti-government protests</a>&nbsp;have been ongoing in Ethiopia's Oromia region, home to the Oromo, since 2015.</p>
<p _translation="奥罗莫占人口的34％以上，长期以来都抱怨政治和经济上的排斥。抗议者的中心要求之一是在国家层面提高政治代表性。">The Oromo, who make up more than 34 percent of the population, have long complained about political and economic exclusion. One of the protesters' central demands has been for greater political representation at the national level.</p>
<p _translation="EPRDF由四个政党组成，主要分为民族阵线：提格拉扬人民解放阵线（TPLF），阿姆哈拉民族民主运动（ANDM），奥罗莫人民民主联盟（OPDO）和南埃塞俄比亚人民民主运动SEPDM）。"><span>The EPRDF is composed of four political parties, mainly divided along ethnic lines: the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organisation (OPDO) and the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM).</span></p>

<p _translation="正在讨论成为总理的最着名的奥罗莫名字是奥罗米亚地区政府的总裁Lemma Megersa和他的副总裁Abiy Ahmed，OPDO的领导人物。">The most prominent Oromo names being discussed to become prime minister are Lemma Megersa, president of the Oromia regional government, and his vice president, Abiy Ahmed, a leading figure in the OPDO.</p>
<p _translation="亚迪斯标准报报道，星期四，81名成员OPDO中央委员会指定艾哈迈德为该党的新主席，从现在担任副主席的Megersa接手。">On Thursday, the 81-member OPDO central committee named Ahmed as the new chairman of the party, taking over from Megersa, who will now serve as deputy chairman, the Addis Standard newspaper reported.</p>
<p _translation="此举被解释为意味着艾哈迈德将成为该党的总理候选人。">The move has been interpreted to mean that Ahmed will be the party's candidate for prime minister.</p>
<p _translation="泰伦斯里昂是美国乔治梅森大学冲突分析与解决学院的副教授，他说&nbsp;如果选择像阿姆哈拉这样的副总理德梅克梅克宁这样的人，那么他可能会“进一步增加燃料，奥罗莫抗议活动“。"><span>Terrence Lyons, an associate professor at the School of Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University in the US, said&nbsp;</span>if someone like Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen, who is Amhara, is chosen instead, that could "add further fuel to the fire of the Oromo protests".</p>
<h2 _translation="分裂的联盟">A divided coalition</h2>
<p _translation="不过，里昂告诉半岛电视台， &nbsp;下任总理的任命是最重要的，因为执政党内部会发生什么事情，控制着埃塞俄比亚议会所有547个席位，自1991年以来一直掌权。"><span><span>Lyons told Al Jazeera the</span>&nbsp;appointment of the next prime minister is most important, however, for what it will say about what is happening inside the ruling party, which controls all 547 seats in Ethiopia's parliament and has been in power since 1991.</span></p>
<p _translation="那一年，EPRDF最初是作为数十年内战中叛乱集团的集合而推翻的，推翻了一个由Mengistu Haile Mariam领导的政府。">That year, the EPRDF - originally formed as a collection of rebel groups fighting in a decades-long civil war - overthrew a government headed by Mengistu Haile Mariam.</p>
<p _translation="前EPRDF主席兼总理梅莱斯在90年代初的过渡时期负责，并于1995年正式当选为总理。">Meles, the former EPRDF chairman and prime minister, was in charge during a transitional period in the early 1990s, before being formally elected in 1995 as prime minister.</p>
<p _translation="里昂斯说，海勒马里安是梅勒斯去世后EPRDF的“有用的占位者”。">Hailemariam&nbsp;was "a useful placeholder" for the EPRDF after Meles's death, Lyons said.</p>

<p _translation="他说，EPRDF实施的政治体制是“非常集中，非常分层次的[并且]决策在高层进行并传达给基层”。">He said the political system the EPRDF brought into force was "very centralised, very hierarchical [and] decisions were made at the top and communicated down to the grassroots".</p>
<p _translation="但矛盾的是，联盟还为新组建的地区政府赋予了地方决策权和自治权，这些地区政府再次大体上沿着种族划分。">But paradoxically, the coalition also granted local decision-making power and autonomy to newly formed regional governments, which were once again largely divided along ethnic lines.</p>
<p _translation="“区域国家控制着法院和大学以及农业和水等广播电台和局，因此政治生活开始变得分散，”里昂解释说。">"The regional states controlled courts and universities and radio stations and bureaus of agriculture and water and so forth, and so the political life began to become decentralised," Lyons explained.</p>
<p _translation="“集权与分权（权力）之间的这种矛盾总是存在，它总是会成为一个问题，现在我们正在看到它。”">"This kind of contradiction between centralising and decentralising [power] was always there, it was always going to be a problem, and now we're seeing it."</p>
<h2 _translation="这个过程">The process</h2>
<p _translation="近年来，许多抗议者也抱怨说他们认为联盟内的提格雷安党所施加的不成比例的权力。">Many of the protesters have also complained in recent years about what they see as the disproportionate power wielded by the Tigrayan party within the coalition.</p>
<p _translation="TPLF从一开始就统治了执政联盟 - 梅勒斯曾经领导过TPLF和EPRDF--尽管Tigrayan人只占埃塞俄比亚1亿多公民的6％。">The TPLF has dominated the ruling coalition from the outset - Meles previously headed both the TPLF and the EPRDF -&nbsp;despite the fact that Tigrayan people constitute only six percent of Ethiopia's more than 100 million citizens.</p>
<p _translation="这两位总理自1991年掌权以来，Hailemariam和Meles也担任联合主席。">Both prime ministers since the party took power in 1991, Hailemariam and Meles, also chaired the coalition.</p>
<p _translation="“任何主持EPRDF的人都是传统上的总理，”Lemma说。">"Whoever is chairing the EPRDF has traditionally been the prime minister," Lemma said.</p>
<p _translation="“这使得[政治体制]几乎不可能改革，因为党和政府是一回事，而这正是埃塞俄比亚人民所厌倦的，这一模糊的路线。”">"This makes reforming the [political system] nearly impossible because party and government are one and the same and this is really what the Ethiopian people are fed up with, this blurred line."</p>
<p _translation="预计180人的EPRDF理事会将在下周举行会议，选择一位新领导人，侯赛因说，那么领导人可能会被议会确认为埃塞俄比亚的下任总理，或者不得不推荐其他人。">The 180-member EPRDF council is expected to meet within the next week to choose a new leader, Hussein said, and that leader would then either be confirmed by parliament as Ethiopia's next prime minister, or have to propose someone else.</p>

<p _translation="EPRDF理事会预计将在3月初举行会议，以决定是否正式接受海勒马里安的辞职，该机构执行委员会成员Getachew Reda&nbsp; 最近告诉彭博社。">The EPRDF council is also expected to meet by early March to decide whether to formally accept Hailemariam's resignation, Getachew Reda, a member of the body's executive committee,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-21/ethiopia-s-next-leader-could-come-from-protest-hit-oromia-region" target="_blank">recently told Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p _translation="任何总理候选人都必须是埃塞俄比亚议会的成员。">Any candidate for prime minister must be a member of Ethiopia's parliament.</p>

<p _translation="在Oromo抗议活动之前，在2011年和2012年，穆斯林埃塞俄比亚人中的大规模抗议活动占据了约30％的人口。他们对据称国家干涉其宗教事务感到愤慨。几位杰出的穆斯林领导人当时被捕。">The Oromo protests were preceded by widespread protests among Muslim Ethiopians - who make up about 30 percent of the population - in 2011 and 2012.

<p _translation="就她而言，亚的斯标准的引理质疑当埃塞俄比亚仍然受到安全机构和商业利益的强烈支配时，任何新领导人如何能够实施真正的改革。">For her part, the Addis Standard's Lemma questioned how any new leader would be able to implement genuine reforms when Ethiopia remains strongly dominated by the security apparatus and business interests.</p>
