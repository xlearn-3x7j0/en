<p _translation="当诗人和记者在米兰遇见五名巴勒斯坦人和叙利亚人，他们在逃离叙利亚战争之后通过意大利兰佩杜萨岛进入欧洲时，他们决定帮助他们完成前往瑞典的旅程 - 并希望避免以贩运者的身份被逮捕 - 通过伪造婚礼派对。">When a poet and journalist meet five Palestinians and Syrians in Milan who entered Europe via the Italian island of Lampedusa after fleeing the war in Syria, they decide to help them complete their journey to Sweden - and hopefully avoid getting themselves arrested as traffickers - by faking a wedding party.</p>

<p _translation="电影制片人的观点&nbsp;"><strong>FILMMAKER'S VIEW&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p _translation="由加布里埃尔德尔格兰德 &nbsp;">By Gabriele del Grande &nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="那是2013年9月，我刚刚到达阿勒颇，由阿什拉菲亚区的四名活动家主持。黎巴嫩歌手Fairuz的声音从一台旧电脑的扬声器中熠熠生辉，窒息了狙击手从城镇另一边枪击的爆炸声和子弹的声音。每次我们试图看窗外，枪手都瞄准了我们。&nbsp;">It was September 2013 and I had just reached Aleppo, hosted by four activists in the Ashrafiya quarter. The voice of the Lebanese singer, Fairuz, booming from the speakers of an old computer, smothered the sound of bomb explosions and bullets shot from the other side of town by a sniper. The gunman aimed at us each time we tried to look out the windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="前线搬到了我们家。我们很无奈。大声的音乐是我们唯一的盾牌，帮助我们不听战争，不看死亡。我们曾经唱歌，跳舞，讲笑话，取笑对方。我们可以听到背景中的炸弹被我们的音乐窒息。&nbsp;">The frontline had moved to our house. We were helpless. Loud music was our only shield, helping us not to hear the war and not to see the death. We used to sing, dance, tell jokes and make fun of each other. We could hear the bombs in the background smothered by our music.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我们歇斯底里地笑了起来，为最坏的情况做好准备。然后，一个小男孩敲我们的门。他拿着婚纱。我们惊讶地看着他。他有一个严肃的表情，当我们让他进去时，他去了厨房，拿着一把屠刀回来。他开始把裙子剪成细条。然后，他给我们每个人一条条，告诉我们把它绑在我们头上并跟着他。">We laughed hysterically, ready for the worst. Then, a young boy knocked on our door. He was holding a wedding dress. We looked at him in astonishment. He had a serious expression and as we let him in, he went to the kitchen and came back holding a butcher's knife. He started to cut the dress into thin strips. Then he gave one strip to each of us and told us to tie it tightly around our heads and follow him.</p>
<p _translation="虽然他不超过12岁，我们也不知道他是谁，但我们决定信任他。因此，当我们的头被包扎成白色时，我们进入了夜晚。整个地区都没有电。我们正在穿过黑暗的小巷，沿着墙壁滑动我们的手掌引导我们。我们可以看到天空中的星星和红色防空灯。">Although he was no older than 12, and we had no idea who he was, we decided to trust him. Thus, with our heads bandaged in white we set out into the night. The entire area had been left without electricity. We were moving through dark alleys, sliding our palms along the walls to guide us. We could see the stars and the red anti-aircraft lights in the sky.</p>
<p _translation="一旦踏上主干道，我们鼓起勇气，深吸一口气跑过去，从不回头。我们全力以赴将我们的身体推向超出我们头顶呼啸的子弹之外。第二天，我明白了：白色是自由叙利亚军队狙击手的信号。意识到一件结婚礼服挽救了我的生活真的让我微笑。">Once on the main road, we plucked up courage, took a deep breath and ran, without ever looking back. It took us all our strength to push our bodies beyond the sound of bullets whistling above our heads. The next day, I understood: white was the signal for the Free Syrian Army's snipers. Realising that a wedding dress had saved my life really made me smile.</p>
<p _translation="我决定保留那条白色织物。一旦我回到米兰，我把它放在一个抽屉里，还有一些从世界各地收集的其他旅行纪念品。我几乎忘了它，直到战争再次撞上我的门，另一件婚纱再次拯救了我们。">I decided to keep that strip of white fabric. Once I was back home in Milan I put it in a drawer, together with some other travel souvenirs collected from around the world. I almost forgot about it, until war knocked on my door again and another wedding dress saved us once more.</p>

<p _translation="一切都是偶然发生的，不到一个月后我从叙利亚返回。我和两个来自大马士革的亲密朋友住在米兰，Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry和Tareq al-Jabr。我们原计划在米兰火车站见面，当一个三十多岁的男人走近我们时，他们正在寻找一家咖啡馆。">Everything happened by chance, no more than a month after my return from Syria. I was with two close friends from Damascus who now live in Milan; Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry and Tareq al-Jabr. We had planned to meet at the train station in Milan and were looking for a cafe when a man in his thirties approached us.</p>
<p _translation="他肩上有一个背包，还有一个新来者的样子。">He had a backpack on his shoulders and the look of a newcomer.</p>
<p _translation="“你知道下一班去瑞典的火车从哪里出发？” 他用阿拉伯语问道。我们笑了。没有列车前往瑞典，所以我们给他一杯咖啡。三个小时后，我们还在坐着，围着烟灰缸里充满空杯和烟头的桌子说话。">"Do you know where the next train to Sweden leaves from?" he asked in Arabic. We laughed. There were no trains leaving for Sweden, so we offered him a coffee. Three hours later we were still sitting, talking around a table full of empty cups and cigarette ends in the ashtray.</p>
<p _translation="他的名字是阿卜杜拉，他是来自大马士革耶尔穆克的叙利亚巴勒斯坦人。他在战争期间逃离了叙利亚，同时他还是拉塔基亚大学的英国文学学生。他于两周前于10月11日抵达意大利，并在250人死亡的海难中奇迹般地幸存下来。我们带他去了米兰的一个接待中心。我们把他留在那里，但他的故事跟着我们回家。">His name was Abdallah and he was a Syrian Palestinian from Yarmouk, in Damascus. He had fled Syria during the war, while he was still an English literature student at the University of Latakya. He had arrived in Italy two weeks earlier, on October 11, and had miraculously survived a shipwreck in which 250 people had died. We took him to a reception centre in Milan. We left him there, but his story followed us home.</p>
<p _translation="这不是第一次。当他们逃离叙利亚战争时，我们已经将许多哈立德索利曼纳斯里的朋友们欢迎到我们的家中。他们通常呆了几天，只是有足够的时间找到可以将他们走私到瑞典的人，他们已经有了家人，朋友或者只是一个同胞的社区。每次他们离开后很长一段时间，他们关于战争的故事都会在我们脑海中产生共鸣，直到我们决定我们必须做点什么。">It was not the first time. We had welcomed many of Khaled Soliman al-Nassiry's friends into our homes as they fled the war in Syria. They usually stayed a couple of days, just enough time to find someone who could smuggle them to Sweden, where they already had family, friends or just a community of fellow countrymen. Each time, long after they had left, their stories about the war would resonate in our heads, until we decided we had to do something.</p>
<p _translation="当我们在我们的朋友Antonio Augugliaro的房子里吃晚餐时，这个想法浮出水面，他是一位电影导演和编辑。我们在谈论阿卜杜拉的故事，关于走私在米兰的叙利亚难民和边境管制。然后我突然出来了，“你知道边防人员永远不会停下来吗？婚礼派对！警察永远不会检查新娘的文件！”">The idea surfaced while we were having dinner at our friend Antonio Augugliaro's house, who is a film director and editor. We were talking about Abdallah's story, about smuggling Syrian refugees in Milan and border controls. Then I suddenly came out with it; "You know who the border guards would never stop? A wedding party! The police would never check a bride's documents!"</p>

<p _translation="这一切都是从一个笑话开始的，直到几天之后，安东尼奥奥古斯塔洛打电话给我和哈立德。他告诉我们他已经考虑过了，我们必须这样做。当我问他在说什么时，他回答说：“来吧！我正在谈论新娘！”&nbsp;">It all started as a joke, until a couple of days later, Antonio Augugliaro called me and Khaled. He told us that he had thought about it and that we had to do it. When I asked him what he was talking about, he replied; "Come on! I'm talking about the bride of course!"&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我简直不敢相信。我们是否真的要假婚礼派对来避免边界管制，并让一群战争难民前往瑞典寻求庇护？">I could hardly believe it. Were we actually going to fake a wedding party to avoid border controls and take a group of war refugees to Sweden to seek asylum?</p>
<p _translation="哈立德，安东尼奥和我见了一杯咖啡，直视彼此的眼睛。我们必须了解我们是否真的要这样做。我们感受到可能永远改变我们生活的选择压力。事实上，帮助这些人离开意大利意味着冒着因密谋协助非法移民而被捕的风险。该罪行判处有期徒刑15年。这是致命的严重，但新娘的梦想比我们的任何想法都强。">Khaled, Antonio and I met for a coffee and looked straight into each other's eyes. We had to understand if we were really going to do this. We felt the pressure of a choice that could change our lives forever. In fact, helping these people to leave Italy meant risking arrest for conspiring to assist illegal immigration. The crime carried a prison term of 15 years. It was deadly serious, yet the dream of the bride was stronger than any second thoughts we had.</p>
<p _translation="我亲眼看到了战争，并记住了2013年10月兰佩杜萨的死亡事件，我们感觉我们做的是正确的事情。对计划的坚定信念使我们忘记了我们正在运行的风险。其余的是肾上腺素。在短短的两周内，我们组织了一场假婚礼，而且还制作了一部电影，将整个冒险变成纪录片。">Having seen war with my own eyes, and remembering the deaths off Lampedusa in October 2013, we felt we were doing the right thing. This firm belief in the plan made us forget the risks we were running. Adrenaline did the rest. In just two weeks we organised a fake wedding party, but also a film production to turn the entire adventure into a documentary.</p>
<p _translation="与此同时，我们还关注物流：租用四辆汽车和一辆面包车，决定行程，在旅途中寻找好客。我们去米兰逛了一家商店，在那里我们可以买一件结婚礼服和优雅的衣服，还有一位为我们计划参与的五名巴勒斯坦人和叙利亚人的发型师。&nbsp;">In the meantime, we also took care of the logistics: renting four cars and a van, deciding the itinerary, looking for hospitality during our journey. And we scoured Milan for a shop where we could buy a wedding dress and elegant clothes, as well as a hairdresser for the five Palestinians and Syrians that we had involved in our plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="我们邀请的第一个人是阿卜杜拉。他将成为新郎。然后，我们与Alaa和他的儿子Manar谈过一个儿童说唱歌手，他用他的音乐赢得了我们的心。最后，艾哈迈德和莫纳，一对属于叙利亚的老对手离开了。至于新娘，我们打电话给我们的巴勒斯坦叙利亚朋友塔斯尼姆，他热情赞同。然后，我发送了一封绝密电子邮件给10位值得信赖的意大利朋友，他们会在边境管制事件中帮助这个化装舞会更可信。">The first person we invited was Abdallah. He was going to be the groom. Then we talked to Alaa and his son Manar, a child rapper who had won our hearts with his music. Finally, Ahmed and Mona, a couple of old opponents belonging to the Syrian left. As for the bride, we called a Palestinian Syrian friend of ours, Tasnim, who agreed with enthusiasm. Then I sent a top secret email to 10 trusted Italian friends who would help make this masquerade more credible in the event of border controls.</p>

<p _translation="离开前一天晚上，当我浏览我的衣橱寻找一件漂亮的衬衫时，我发现了阿勒颇的白色绷带。我在镜子前面的前额上试了一下。它仍然适合我。有一刻我充满了回忆。">The night before leaving, as I browsed through my wardrobe looking for a smart shirt, I found the white bandage from Aleppo. I tried it on my forehead, in front of the mirror. It still suited me. For a moment I was filled with memories.</p>
<p _translation="我看到当时遇难的阿布阿德尔，然后是最近订婚但仍然带着他的照相机前往阿勒颇的布什金和原本应该启动广播电台的阿布·穆罕默德，而是最终住院了，用迫击炮击伤。">I saw Abu Adel, who had been killed in those days, then Bushkin, who had recently got engaged but was still going around Aleppo with his camera, and Abu Mohammad, who was supposed to start a radio station, and instead ended up in hospital, wounded by a mortar.</p>
<p _translation="然后我睁开眼睛，觉得我们可以做到。婚纱会再次保护我们。离开房子前，我把白色的绷带折起来放在口袋里。">Then I opened my eyes and felt we could make it. The wedding dress would protect us again. I folded the white bandage and put it in my pocket before leaving the house.</p>
<p _translation="几小时后，我遇到了我的旅伴。我们共有23人; 意大利人，巴勒斯坦人和叙利亚人。每个人都穿着适当的婚纱 - 来自地中海两岸的年轻男女，准备冒险一切，共同证明有时梦想成真，而且希望依然存在。">A few hours later, I met my travel companions. There were 23 of us altogether; Italians, Palestinians and Syrians. Everybody was dressed in proper wedding clothes – young men and women from both shores of the Mediterranean, ready to risk everything, together, to prove that sometimes dreams come true, and that hope still exists.</p>

<p _translation="我们离开的那一天，我们不知道我们的冒险可能会触及世界各地的许多人。我们一回到米兰就发现了它，并且我们发起了一场众筹活动来资助这部纪录片; 来自37个不同国家的2,617名支持者捐赠了10万欧元。">The day we left, we had no idea that our adventure could touch so many people around the world. We discovered it as soon as we returned to Milan and we launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the documentary; 2,617 supporters from 37 different countries had donated 100,000 euro.</p>
<p _translation="这是有史以来意大利和巴勒斯坦电影史上最大的众筹活动。得益于他们的支持，我们能够及时完成后期制作，进入第71届威尼斯国际电影节。">It was the biggest ever crowdfunding campaign in the history of Italian and Palestinian cinema. Thanks to their support, we were able to finish the post-production in time to enter the 71&nbsp;Venice International Film Festival.</p>
<p _translation="这部电影被选中并获得三项评委特别奖。一年后，它在意大利获得了戏剧发行，并在全球许多最大的国际纪录片节（IDFA，HotDocs和DocEdge等等）中都有发布。它还在全球36个国家放映，在意大利的SKY频道播放，现在以半岛电视台英语播放。">The film was selected and won three special awards of the jury. One year later, it had been given a theatrical release in Italy and was featured in many of the biggest international documentary festivals around the world (IDFA, HotDocs and DocEdge, to name a few). It has also been screened in 36 countries worldwide, broadcasted on Italy's SKY channel, and now on Al Jazeera English.</p>
<p _translation="令人惊讶的是，像我们这样的一群浪漫主义者的疯狂想法能够赢得全球众多人的心。我们想证明地中海不仅仅是一座公墓，而且它也可以是联合我们的大海。在新娘的一面就是这样。&nbsp;">It is amazing how the crazy idea of a bunch of romantics like us could win the hearts of so many people around the world. We wanted to prove that the Mediterranean is not just a cemetery, but that it can also be the sea that unites us. <em>On The Bride's Side</em> does just that.&nbsp;</p>
