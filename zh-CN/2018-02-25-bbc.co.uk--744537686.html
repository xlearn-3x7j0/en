But not all of them match the popular image of a jihadi, as Helen Nianias discovered when she met a hipsterish young man for coffee in the Kosovan capital, Pristina.</p><p _translation="一个短胡子，一件黑豌豆大衣和一个困惑的表情在这个智能咖啡馆的桌子间摆弄着我。坐下来，他看起来有点尴尬，因为一大杯咖啡上放着一大杯鲜奶油放在他面前。">A man with a short beard, a dark pea coat and a bemused expression weaves towards me between the tables of this smart cafe. Sitting down, he looks slightly embarrassed as a tall glass of coffee topped with a huge quiff of whipped cream is put in front of him. </p><p _translation="这是Albert Iberisha。他31岁，五年前去叙利亚战斗。">This is Albert Iberisha.

Articulate and focused, he says his primary reason for going to Syria was to oppose the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. </p><p _translation="为了误导电影Withnail和我，艾伯特去“错误地”战斗，在不舒服和可怕的经历之间跳跃。在这个短暂而多事的时期，他说al-Nusra Front--一度曾隶属于基地组织的一个团体 - 在让他离开之前试图征召他。然后，他去了一群同族阿尔巴尼亚人 - 然后才发现他们想加入所谓的伊斯兰国家，他不想这样做。  ">To misquote the film Withnail and I, Albert went to fight "by mistake", ricocheting between uncomfortable and frightening experiences. During this brief but eventful period, he says al-Nusra Front - a group once affiliated to al-Qaeda - tried to enlist him, before letting him go. Then he went to stay with a group of fellow ethnic Albanians - before finding out they were trying to join so-called Islamic State, which he didn't want to do.  </p><figure>

He was taught how to take apart, clean and reassemble a Kalashnikov, but maintains that he never fought.

The way he tells the story he was not radical, but naïve - before he got there, Albert's knowledge of Syria was mostly gleaned from online videos.</p><p _translation="“我曾设想过这种对阿萨德的反对意见，他们没有犯罪背景的人，”他说。用他的话说，他认为“只有善意的人想帮助人民”。">"I had imagined this opposition to Assad didn't have people with criminal backgrounds in the ranks," he says.
