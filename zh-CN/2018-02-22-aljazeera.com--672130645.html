<p _translation="一位发言人说，比利·格雷厄姆在讲台上70年的时间里向全世界的总统提供过建议并向全世界数以百万计的人讲道。">Billy Graham, who counseled presidents and preached to millions across the world during his 70 years in the pulpit, died on Wednesday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p _translation="根据他的事工，他向历史上任何其他人宣传基督教，通过亲自或通过电视和卫星线路向成千上万的人传播基督教。">According to his ministry, he preached Christianity to more people than anyone else in history, reaching hundreds of millions of people either in person or via TV and satellite links.</p>
<p _translation="“他可能是他那个时代的统治宗教领袖，”威廉马丁说，“先知荣誉：比利格雷厄姆的故事”的作者。">"He was probably the dominant religious leader of his era," said William Martin, author of "A Prophet With Honor: The Billy Graham Story."</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆的声誉在与尼克松秘密录制谈话后受到了重创，在这次谈话中，传教士抱怨说，1972年犹太人对美国媒体的影响太大。但他说他不记得谈话并道歉。他也不赞同同性恋，但在他职业生涯的晚年，他故意淡化他的政治信仰，专注于福音。">Graham’s reputation took a hit after secretly recorded conversation with Nixon &nbsp;in which the evangelist complained that Jews had too much influence on the US media <span>surfaced in 1972</span>. But &nbsp;said he could not remember the conversation and apologized. He also did not approve of gays but in the later years of his career he intentionally muted his political beliefs to focus on the Gospel.</p>
<p _translation="他还会见了许多世界领导人，并且是第一位着名的福音传教士，在铁幕后面传达他的信息。">He also met with scores of world leaders and was the first noted evangelist to take his message behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p _translation="唐纳德特朗普总统在Twitter上说：“伟大的葛培理已经死了，没有人喜欢他，他会被基督徒和所有的宗教错过，一个非常特别的人。">President Donald Trump said on Twitter: "The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man."</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆于2013年11月7日在北卡罗莱纳州阿什维尔的一家酒店庆祝了他的95岁生日，其中特朗普，商业巨头鲁珀特默多克和电视女主持人凯西李吉福德是约800名客人中的一员。">Graham had celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 7, 2013, at a hotel in Asheville, North Carolina, where Trump, business magnate Rupert Murdoch and television hostess Kathie Lee Gifford were among some 800 guests.</p>
<p _translation="该活动展示了他的儿子富兰克林所说的布道视频，这是格雷厄姆向全国传递的最后信息。在那里，他说美国“非常需要精神上的觉醒”。">The event featured a video of a sermon that his son Franklin said was Graham’s last message to the nation. In it, he said America was "in great need of a spiritual awakening."</p>
<p _translation="格拉汉姆凭借其钢铁般的特征和炯炯有力的蓝眼睛，在他巅峰时期传教时，他是一个强大的人物，漫游在舞台上，提起圣经，因为他宣称耶稣基督是人类问题的唯一解决方案。">With his steely features and piercing blue eyes, Graham was a powerful figure when he preached in his prime, roaming the stage and hoisting a Bible as he declared Jesus Christ to be the only solution to humanity’s problems.</p>
<p _translation="在他的鼎盛时期，格雷厄姆以雷鸣般的快速演讲风格赢得了他的绰号“上帝的机枪”。通过他为“基督的十字军东征”，格雷厄姆在美国中心地区投入了热爱的领域，这将成为宗教权利保守派政治运动发展的沃土。">In his heyday Graham had a thunderous, quick-burst speaking style that earned him the nickname "God’s Machine Gun." Through his "Crusades for Christ," Graham sowed fields of devotion across the American heartland that would become fertile ground for the growth of the religious right’s conservative political movement.</p>
<h2 _translation="白宫律师">White House counsel</h2>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆在哈里杜鲁门任职期间开始与总统见面。他与杰拉尔德福特打高尔夫球，与林登约翰逊一起在白宫游泳池中嬉戏，与乔治HW布什一起度假，在尼克松执政的第一天在白宫过夜。">Graham started meeting with presidents during the tenure of Harry Truman. He played golf with Gerald Ford, skinny-dipped in the White House pool with Lyndon Johnson, vacationed with George HW Bush and spent the night in the White House on Nixon’s first day in office.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆成为几位美国总统的事实上的白宫牧师，最着名的是理查德尼克松。">Graham became the de facto White House chaplain to several US presidents, most famously Richard Nixon.</p>
<p _translation="乔治·W·布什授予格雷厄姆的信誉，帮助他重新发现自己的信仰，2010年，当格雷厄姆难以出行时，巴拉克奥巴马前往北卡罗来纳州蓝岭山脉的牧师小木屋。">George W Bush gave Graham credit for helping him rediscover his faith and in 2010, when it was difficult for Graham to travel, Barack Obama made the trip to the preacher’s log cabin home in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
<p _translation="他与白宫的关系是互利的。作为传教士的传道人，他的声誉得到了提升，而政治家们则以倾向于选民的选民的身份提升了他们的地位。">His ties to the White House were mutually beneficial. His reputation was enhanced as preacher to the presidents, while the politicians boosted their standing with religiously inclined voters.</p>
<p _translation="“他们的个人生活 - 其中一些 - 很困难，”注册民主党人格雷厄姆在2007年向他的政治熟人透露时代杂志。“但是我爱他们，我很钦佩他们，我知道他们的负担超出了我所能理解或理解的范围。”">"Their personal lives - some of them - were difficult," Graham, a registered Democrat, told Time magazine in 2007 of his political acquaintances. "But I loved them all. I admired them all. I knew that they had burdens beyond anything I could ever know or understand."</p>
<h2 _translation="政治观点">Political views</h2>
<p _translation="在他职业生涯的前半期，格雷厄姆经常谈及当时的社会和政治问题，包括他强烈的反共情绪。他将越南战争抗议者否认为注意力寻求者，尽管他最终拒绝举行隔离复兴会议，但他并未在1960年代的民权运动中发挥积极作用。">In the early half of his career, Graham often spoke his mind on social and political issues of the day, including his strong anti-communist sentiments. He dismissed Vietnam War protesters as attention-seekers and, while he eventually refused to hold segregated revival meetings, he did not take an active role in the 1960s civil rights movement.</p>
<p _translation="但是，格雷厄姆的政治并不像追随他的一些宗教领袖那样公开，比如1988年竞选总统的帕特罗伯逊，以及旨在促进基督教的道德多数的共同创始人杰瑞福尔韦尔。以政治为导向。">But Graham’s politics were not as overt as those of some religious leaders who came after him, such as Pat Robertson, who ran for president in 1988, and Jerry Falwell, co-founder of the Moral Majority, an organization whose purpose was to promote Christian-oriented politics.</p>
<p _translation="随着年龄的增长，格雷厄姆说他感觉自己已经过度卷入一些问题，并转向中间位置以接触更多的人。然而，他确实在2012年深入了解同性婚姻问题，当时他出面支持北卡罗来纳州禁止同性婚姻的州修正案。他还在2012年10月与共和党米特罗姆尼会面，并告诉他他支持罗姆尼竞选总统。">As he grew older, Graham said he felt he had become too involved in some issues and shifted to a middle-of-the-road position in order to reach more people. He did, however, dive into the gay marriage issue in 2012 when he came out in support of a state amendment to ban same-sex marriages in North Carolina. He also met with Republican Mitt Romney in October 2012 and told him he supported Romney’s run for the presidency.</p>
<h2 _translation="从农场到讲坛">From farm to pulpit</h2>
<p _translation="威廉富兰克林格雷厄姆1918年11月7日出生在长老会家庭，在北卡罗来纳州夏洛特附近的一个农场长大时被称为比利弗兰克。作为一名青少年，他说他大部分时间都忙于棒球和女孩，直到他在夏洛特听到火热的复兴主义者之后被神感动。">William Franklin Graham was born on Nov. 7, 1918, into a Presbyterian family and was known as Billy Frank while growing up on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. As a teenager, he said he was mostly preoccupied with baseball and girls until he was moved by God after hearing a fiery revivalist in Charlotte.</p>
<p _translation="在参加鲍勃琼斯学院后，格雷厄姆最终在佛罗里达的一所圣经学校学习，在那里他会在第一次复兴时宣讲，并于1939年由南浸信会公会的一个教会任命。他在芝加哥附近的Wheaton大学获得奖学金，在那里他遇到了Ruth Bell，他的父母是中国的传教士。他们于1943年结婚。">After attending Bob Jones College, Graham ended up at a Bible school in Florida, where he would preach at his first revival, and was ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention. He received a scholarship to Wheaton College near Chicago, where he met Ruth Bell, whose parents were missionaries in China. They married in 1943.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆没有在家庭教堂工作，而是走上了路，在帐篷里讲道，并建立了一个跟随者。他的突破带来了1949年的洛杉矶帐篷运动，原定三周，但由于他吸引了过多的人群而延长到八年。">Rather than work from a home church, Graham went on the road, preaching in tents and building a following. His breakthrough came with a 1949 Los Angeles tent crusade that was scheduled for three weeks but extended to eight because of the overflow crowds he attracted.</p>
<p _translation="洛杉矶战役的成功以及格雷厄姆的成名归功于媒体大亨威廉伦道夫赫斯特，他非常喜欢格雷厄姆的风格和反共立场，所以他命令他的报纸给格雷厄姆加油。">The success of the Los Angeles campaign and the fame it brought Graham was attributed to media magnate William Randolph Hearst, who had liked Graham’s style and anti-communist stance so much that he ordered his newspapers to give Graham a boost.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆最终超过了帐篷的复兴，并将在世界上一些最着名的场地进行宣传，如扬基体育场和纽约麦迪逊广场花园以及伦敦温布利大球场。他在世界各地发表讲道，包括偏远的非洲村庄，中国，朝鲜，苏联，东德，捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利。">Graham eventually outgrew tent revivals and would preach at some of the most famous venues in the world, such as Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden in New York and London’s Wembley Stadium. He delivered sermons around the globe, including in remote African villages, China, North Korea, the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</p>
<p _translation="自由派指责他给予虐待政府信誉，而原教旨主义基督徒则批评他去无神的国家并促进与他们的和平关系。格雷厄姆说他只是把这次旅行视为非政治机会为基督赢得灵魂。">Liberals accused him of giving credibility to abusive governments while fundamentalist Christians criticized him for going to godless countries and promoting peaceful relations with them. Graham said he simply saw the trips as apolitical opportunities to win souls for Christ.</p>
<p _translation="他的组织表示，格雷厄姆于2005年6月在纽约结束了他的宗教运动生涯，其三天展位吸引了超过23万人参加。他把他的福音派协会交给了他的儿子富兰克林，他不会回避政治，而且一旦他成为总统，他就经常称赞特朗普。">Graham concluded his career of religious campaigns in June 2005 in New York with a three-day stand that attracted more than 230,000 people, his organization said. He turned over his evangelical association to his son Franklin, who did not shy away from politics and frequently praised Trump once he became president.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆的其他四个孩子也是福音传教士。">Graham’s other four children were also evangelists.</p>
<p _translation="他的组织表示，计划在3月2日在北卡罗来纳州夏洛特的比利格雷厄姆图书馆门前举行葬礼，场地可容纳约2300人。它说他将被安葬在他妻子露丝旁边的图书馆。她于2007年6月14日去世。这对夫妇有两个儿子和三个女儿。">A funeral at a venue that holds about 2,300 people is planned for March 2 in front of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, his organization said. It said he will be buried on library premises next to his wife, Ruth. She died on June 14, 2007. The couple had two sons and three daughters.</p>
<p _translation="家庭发言人Mark DeMoss表示，格雷厄姆的遗体将于下周一和周二安息在位于图书馆遗址的格雷厄姆家中，该家已从原来的位置搬到了夏洛特。">Graham’s body will lie in repose next Monday and Tuesday at the Graham family house which is now at the library site, having been moved from its original location, also in Charlotte, said family spokesman Mark DeMoss.</p>
<p _translation="当格雷厄姆在1950年开始他的事工时，他会在他称之为“帆布大教堂”的帐篷下讲道，“德莫斯说。他说，格雷厄姆在帐篷下的葬礼服务提醒了他的事工是如何开始的。">When Graham began his ministry in 1950, he would preach under a tent he called a "canvas cathedral," DeMoss said. He said having Graham’s funeral service under a tent is a reminder of how his ministry began.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆本人“几年前亲自批准了这项服务的规划和细节”，德莫斯周三在夏洛特的新闻发布会上说。">Graham himself "personally approved the planning and details of the service some years ago," said DeMoss, speaking at a press conference in Charlotte on Wednesday night.</p>
<h2 _translation="声誉">Reputation</h2>
<p _translation="尽管其他电视明星福音传播者，如吉姆巴克尔和吉米斯瓦加特在20世纪80年代因金融和性丑闻而受到打击，但格雷厄姆仍然保持着公信力。为了保持自己的声誉，格雷厄姆有一个从不与露丝以外的任何女人单独的政策。">Graham maintained his public integrity even as other TV star evangelists such as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart were hit in the 1980s by financial and sex scandals. To keep his reputation pristine, Graham had a policy of never being alone with any woman other than Ruth.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆最接近的总统关系是尼克松，尼克松向他提供了他想要的任何政府工作，包括驻以色列大使。对于格雷厄姆来说，这是一种痛苦的关系，尼克松和他的圈子在水门事件丑闻中误导了他。">Graham’s closest presidential relationship was with Nixon, who offered him any government job he wanted - including ambassador to Israel. It turned out to be a painful relationship for Graham, who said Nixon and his circle misled him on the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p _translation="尼克松助手HR Haldeman在1994年的一本书中首次提到了格雷厄姆的反犹太言论，格雷厄姆坚决否认。但是，当尼克松白宫的录音带在2002年被释放时，格雷厄姆可能听说提及犹太人是色情作家，并同意尼克松的看法，认为美国媒体被自由派犹太人统治，并可能使美国“陷入困境”。">Nixon aide HR Haldeman first mentioned Graham’s anti-Semitic remarks in a 1994 book, which Graham strongly denied. But when audio tapes from the Nixon White House were released in 2002, Graham could be heard referring to Jews as pornographers and agreeing with Nixon that the US media was dominated by liberal Jews and could send the United States "down the drain."</p>
<p _translation="在支持以色列方面有着悠久历史的格雷厄姆在磁带发布后再次道歉，并表示他没有回忆谈话。">Graham, who had a long history of supporting Israel, apologized again after the tapes’ release and said he had no recollection of the conversation.</p>
<p _translation="“如果它不在录像带上，我不会相信它，”格雷厄姆告诉新闻周刊。“我想我正在努力讨好，我对自己感觉如此糟糕 - 我无法相信，我和犹太领导人开了一次会议，我告诉他们我会爬过去问他们的原谅。”">"If it wasn’t on tape, I would not have believed it," Graham told Newsweek. "I guess I was trying to please. I felt so badly about myself - I couldn’t believe it. I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness."</p>
<p _translation="超过二十多本着作如“如何重生”等书籍的作者，格雷厄姆在星期天在世界各地广播了“每小时决定”广播节目超过50年。">The author of more than two dozen books with titles such as "How to Be Born Again," Graham also ran the weekly "Hour of Decision" radio program broadcast around the world on Sundays for more than 50 years.</p>
<p _translation="格雷厄姆帮助把宗教带入电视时代。他首先在1951年制作了一个电视节目，最终集结在一起，并于1957年开始从纽约麦迪逊广场花园直播他的复兴会议。">Graham helped bring religion into the television age. He first put together a television show, which was eventually syndicated, in 1951 and began live broadcasts of his revival meetings in 1957 from New York’s Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p _translation="在2011年的福克斯新闻采访中，格雷厄姆被问到他在职业生涯中会做些什么不同。">In a 2011 Fox News interview, Graham was asked what he would do differently in his career.</p>
<p _translation="“我会学习更多，我会多祷告，少走路，少讲话，”他说。“我在世界上太多的地方把太多的人带走了，如果我再把它做了，我会花更多的时间在冥想和祈祷上，只是告诉主，我有多爱他。”">"I would study more. I would pray more, travel less, take less speaking engagements," he said. "I took too many of them in too many places around the world. If I had it to do over again I’d spend more time in meditation and prayer and just telling the Lord how much I love him."</p>
<p _translation="除了患有帕金森病多年以外，格雷厄姆晚年的健康问题还包括髋部骨折，骨盆骨折，前列腺癌以及在他的大脑中安装分流器以控制多余的液体。他在2011年，2012年和2013年因呼吸问题住院。">In addition to suffering with Parkinson’s disease for many years, Graham’s health problems in his later years included a broken hip, a broken pelvis, prostate cancer and installation of a shunt in his brain to control excess fluid. He was hospitalized in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for respiratory problems.</p></div></div>
