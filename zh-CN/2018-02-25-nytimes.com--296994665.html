Shuster and his team love to complicate the game and force their opponents into making mistakes. And that’s exactly what happened. Edin had a bad miss with his first. Shuster applied more pressure and on Edin’s last throw he was a little heavy and wide giving up a steal to the Americans.</p>
<p data-para-count="328" data-total-count="10571" id="story-continues-14" _translation="关于这次偷窃的重要之处在于现在瑞典人的最后一块石头是奇怪的。美国人希望在第五阶段强制瑞典队取得单一的一点，并试图在第六，第八和第十场结束时保持最后的摇滚。这就是他们如何尝试玩这款游戏，为游戏的最后一拍留下最后的摇滚优势。">What’s important about this steal is now the Swedes have last rock in the odd ends. Americans want to force Sweden to a single point in the 5th end and try to keep the last rock in the 6th, 8th and 10th and final end. That’s how they’ll try to play this game out, to have last rock advantage for the last shot of the game.</p><h4 data-para-count="34" data-total-count="10605" _translation="第五场结束：瑞典队在休息时间领先">5th End: Sweden Leads at the Break</h4><p data-para-count="288" data-total-count="10893" _translation="约翰·舒斯特在他最后一块石头上沉重，这闪过了房子，意味着它直线前进而没有触及任何东西，而瑞典则大写，在我们进入第五节结束时打进两球，重新夺回领先优势。（这对你来说是足球迷的半场比赛）。压力越来越大。">John Shuster was heavy on his last stone, which flashed the house, meaning it rolled straight through without touching anything, and Sweden capitalized, scoring two to regain the lead as we head into the fifth-end break. (That’s halftime to you football fans.) The pressure is mounting.</p><p data-para-count="186" data-total-count="11079" _translation="但请记住：美国队赢得了四场比赛直入决赛。他们的化学从未如此好过。另外，T先生告诉他们要赢。我可怜那位让T先生失望的傻瓜。">But remember: The Americans won four straight matches heading into this final. Their chemistry has never been better. Also, Mr. T told them to win. I pity the fool who disappoints Mr. T.</p><p data-para-count="353" data-total-count="11432" _translation="德文·赫鲁克斯：这是美国人在第五节结束时的更多教科书 - 混乱，混乱和混乱，这正是球队赢得比赛的原因。舒斯特喜欢大量的石块，喜欢对对手施加压力。瑞典已陷入陷阱并正在努力摆脱它。当舒斯特领先时，他打得非常有信心。"><strong>Devin Heroux:</strong> It was more textbook American curling in the 5th end — cluttered, confusing and messy, which is exactly how this team wins games. Shuster likes a lot of rocks in play and loves to put pressure on his opponents. Sweden has fallen into the trap and are struggling to escape it. When Shuster has a lead, he plays with tremendous confidence.</p><p data-para-count="206" data-total-count="11638" _translation="但这场比赛可能是无情的。舒斯特对他的最后一投很沉重，而且爱丁得到了一个完美的平局，得到两分。这场比赛需要8次投篮才能得分。舒斯特错过了一次。埃丁没有。">But the game can be unforgiving. Shuster was heavy on his last shot and Edin made a perfect draw shot to score two points. It takes eight made shots to score in this game. Shuster missed one.

It was a small but significant blunder, and Edin doesn’t usually make small but significant blunders. The Americans are getting their opportunities, and John Shuster made two solid shots to ultimately score two. The United States pulls back ahead.</p><p data-para-count="205" data-total-count="12270" _translation="Devin Heroux：当你达到这种卷曲水平时，最轻微的错误可能是不同的。他在第一次投篮时错过了一场艰难的回击，让美国人把两块石头放在房子里。"><strong>Devin Heroux:</strong> When you get to this level of curling, the slightest error can be the difference.

The ice conditions change throughout the game due to rocks sliding over and over the ice. It can also change because of the body heat in the building, creating frost on the ice. The players have to adapt. The teams that are able to do this first win the game.</p><h4 data-para-count="45" data-total-count="12785" _translation="第七名结束：瑞典的爱丁感受到压力">7th End: Sweden’s Edin Feeling the Pressure</h4><p data-para-count="350" data-total-count="13135" _translation="世界上最好的卷发棒Niklas Edin似乎感觉到了奥运压力。在第七次结束的第一次射门之后，他又一次怀有巨大的怀念，他用锤子反弹为瑞典队保住了一分，并将比分追平。但是美国的状态很好，锤子已经达到了第八位 - 并且有望在第十位获得。">Niklas Edin, the finest curler in the world, appears to be feeling that Olympic pressure. After another huge miss with his first shot of the seventh end, he bounced back to save a point for Sweden with the hammer, tying the score. But the United States is in great shape, with the hammer heading to the eighth — and on track to have it in the 10th.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-16">Continue reading the main story</a>
