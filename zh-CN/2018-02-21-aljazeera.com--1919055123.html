<p _translation="“我病得很重，一直昏倒，幸运的是，有一个民间团体听到了我的故事，并帮助我获得了释放，然后我被授予了日本居民身份，并于2001年终于回到了韩国。">"I got very ill and kept fainting.

No one wanted to deal with that.</p>
<p _translation="“统一部为每个叛逃者提供大约20万韩元（188美元）的殡葬费，但这并不足够，并且是非常不尊重的，因为他们中的很多人没有家人，如果他们死了，他们会死亡为木乃伊。">"The ministry of unification gives around 200,000 Korean Won ($188) as funeral fee for each defector but that's not adequate and extremely disrespectful because a lot of them don't have a family here.

There are a lot of young women in China who are sold in the sex industry or as wives. Men are also treated as slaves and they'll be forced to work on farms but won't be given any money.</p>
<p _translation="“到目前为止，我已经拯救了近6000名叛逃者，媒体称我为'叛逆者之父'，但这项工作尚未完成。">"I've saved almost 6,000 defectors so far and the media calls me the 'Father of Defectors'. But the job isn't done yet.</p>

<p _translation="“很难想象北方的局势会发生变化，这不是一生中可能发生的事情，但如果金正恩政权倒台，我会把我的武器越过边界并报复。现在，我认为我不会浪费时间思考可能永远不会发生的事情。“">"It's really hard to imagine that the situation in the North would change. It's not something that could happen in my lifetime. But if the Kim Jong-un regime was to fall, I would take my weapons across the border and take revenge.
