But the notification led White House lawyers and aides to believe that they were more problematic than the complexity of his finances and his initial failure to disclose contacts with foreign leaders — the reasons Mr. Kushner’s lawyers have said are holding up the process, the two people said.</p><p data-para-count="462" data-total-count="1209" _translation="临时许可使他能够获得严密保护的信息，包括总统每日简报，特朗普先生每天收到的情报摘要。由于白宫工作人员秘书Rob Porter的长期安全检查延迟了一年，因此总参谋长John F.

The issue took on added urgency after the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, issued a sweeping review of interim clearances in response to the disclosure that the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, had his permanent security clearance delayed for a year because of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/us/politics/rob-porter-resigns-abuse-white-house-staff-secretary.html">spousal abuse allegations</a>.</p><p data-para-count="161" data-total-count="1370" _translation="在给白宫工作人员的一份备忘录中，凯利先生说，他将切断高层访问许多未能获得永久许可的助手。">In a memo to the White House staff, Mr. Kelly said that he would cut off high-level access to many of the aides who had been unable to get a permanent clearance.</p>
