<p _translation="当你监禁一名记者时，这是对新闻自由和言论自由的攻击。这并不意味着记者超越了法律。作为每个公民，我们都有责任尊重法律。我无法无故偷盗或杀人。但这些记者发生的事情就是我们所说的“新闻工作的刑事化”，即你把他们的工作形容为犯罪，这是对新闻自由的攻击。">When you jail a journalist, it is an attack on press freedom and freedom of expression. This doesn't mean journalists are above the law. We have, as every citizen, the duty to respect the law. I can't steal or kill someone without any reason. But what happened with these journalists is what we call "criminalisation of journalistic work", namely, you describe their work as a crime and that is an attack against press freedom.</p>

Kennedy Human Rights group, says that "the state [Egypt] is pretty much employing all the tools that we see repressive regimes around the world employ in order to restrict civic space, all at once. So there is direct intimidation, harassment, arrest of human rights defenders and journalists and activists, torture and mistreatment of those individuals once they are arrested and then detained."</p>
