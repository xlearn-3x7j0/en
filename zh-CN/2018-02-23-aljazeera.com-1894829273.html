<p _translation="意大利即将举行的大选已经被视为对欧洲的考验，因为右翼民粹主义日益增多，人们对移民的焦虑加剧。">Italy's upcoming election has been billed as a test for <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a> amid growing right-wing populism and increasing anxiety over migration.</p>
<p _translation="由于&nbsp;经济停滞和极右翼政党对整个非洲大陆的收益普遍&nbsp; 感到愤怒，意大利人将在3月4日投票选举新政府。">With widespread&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/italian-elections-crisis-european-democracy-180216185914053.html">anger</a>&nbsp;over economic stagnation and far-right parties making gains across the continent, Italians will cast their ballots to choose a new government on March 4.</p>
<p _translation="该国许多政界人士都将焦点集中在难民和移民问题上，其中近12万人2017年抵达意大利。">Many of the country's politicians have <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/italy-exploits-migration-crisis-180114200719130.html">focused their ire</a> on refugees and migrants, nearly 120,000 of whom <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/italy/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-reach-5502-2018-deaths-reach-213" target="_blank">arrived</a> in Italy in 2017.</p>
<p _translation="在反对移民的各方当中包括民粹主义者五星运动（M5S），联盟（也称为北方联盟），自称法西斯党的卡萨邦普和新法西斯主义者Forza Nuova。">Among the parties railing against immigration are the populist <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/can-beppe-grillo-internet-demo-2014823124259908116.html">Five Star Movement</a> (M5S), The League (also known as the Northern League), the self-professed fascist party <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/remembering-italy-cervi-brothers-surge-180213164326651.html">CasaPound</a> and the neo-fascist Forza Nuova.</p>
<h2 _translation="预计什么？">What's expected?</h2>
<p _translation="根据最近的民意调查显示，各方目前都没有指定创建政府所需的40％的必要支持水平，这是去年在新法律中引入的一项要求。">According to recent polls, none of the parties currently command the requisite 40 percent support level needed to create a government, a requirement that was introduced in a new law last year.</p>
<p _translation="在这种情况下，总统必须找到一个建立政府的跨党派解决方案，必须组建一个大联合政府，否则意大利人会在没有达成可行政府的情况下回到民意调查中。">In such a scenario, the president would have to find a cross-party solution to create a government, a grand coalition would have to be formed, or Italians would head back to the polls if no workable government is agreed upon.</p>
<p _translation="格鲁吉亚大学公共与国际事务学院副教授Cas Mudde解释说，没有一次选举可能是对更广泛民粹主义现象的考验。">Cas Mudde, an associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia, explained that no single election could be a test for the broader populist phenomenon.</p>
<p _translation="“最重要的是，意大利一直是一个离群点，具有坚实的民粹主义传统至少可以追溯到90年代初，”Mudde的学者关注民粹主义，告诉半岛电视台。">"On top of that, Italy has long been an outlier, with a solid populist tradition going back at least till the early 1990s," Mudde, whose scholarship has focused on populism, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="“它也有非常特殊的经济和政治环境。”">"It also has very particular economic and political circumstances."</p>
<h2 _translation="贝卢斯科尼在最右边的床上吗？">Is Berlusconi in bed with the far right?</h2>
<p _translation="西尔维奥贝卢斯科尼的Forza Italia晚会与The League达成协议，由极右派政治家Matteo Salvini和一对较小的右翼政党领导。&nbsp;">Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party has struck a deal with The League, headed by far-right politician Matteo Salvini and a pair of smaller right-wing parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="虽然贝卢斯科尼在选举中被禁止参加竞选，但由于2013年的税务欺诈罪，该党领导的集团截至上周平均投票率为36％。">While Berlusconi is personally barred from running in the elections, owing to a 2013 tax fraud conviction, the bloc led by his party was polling at an average of 36 percent as of last week.</p>

<p _translation="过去，媒体大亨贝卢斯科尼曾担任总理九年总理，使他成为自第二次世界大战结束后服务时间最长的统治者。">In the past, Berlusconi, a media tycoon, served as prime minister for a combined total of nine years, making him the country's longest-serving ruler since the end of the Second World War.</p>

<p _translation="萨尔维尼已经承诺驱逐50万难民和移民。本月早些时候，马切拉塔前联盟本地候选人 被怀疑发生车祸枪击，打伤 &nbsp;6名非洲移民。">Salvini has pledged to deport upwards of half a million refugees and migrants. Earlier this month, a former local candidate for the League in Macerata<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/words-african-victims-gun-attack-180211054550845.html"> </a>was suspected of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/words-african-victims-gun-attack-180211054550845.html">shooting and injuring</a>&nbsp;six African migrants in a drive-by shooting.</p>
<p _translation="虽然Salvini过去曾对欧盟提出过批评，但他表示他不会就意大利加入这个28个国家的集团进行公民投票。">Although Salvini has railed in the past against the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>, he has said he will not seek a referendum on Italy's membership in the 28-country bloc.</p>
<p _translation="英国伯明翰大学欧洲政治学高级讲师丹尼尔阿尔伯塔齐说，贝卢斯科尼与右翼政党结盟是“非常成熟”的一部分。">Daniele Albertazzi, a senior lecturer in European politics at Birmingham University in the UK, said that the Berlusconi alliance with right-wing parties is part of a "very well established" relationship.</p>
<p _translation="“贝卢斯科尼曾四次担任总理，他一直得到北部联盟的支持，”他告诉半岛电视台。">"Berlusconi has been prime minister four times, and he's always had the support of the Northern League," he told Al Jazeera.</p>
<h2 _translation="左边站在哪里？">Where does the left stand?</h2>
<p _translation="2007年成立的是将不同中左翼政党联合起来，目前控制执政联盟的民主党（PD）投票率约为23％。">Founded to bring together disparate centre-left parties in 2007, the Democratic Party (PD), which currently controls the governing coalition, is polling at around 23 percent.</p>
<p _translation="在前总理马蒂奥伦齐（2014-2016）的领导下，该党近几个月来失去了大部分支持。">Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (2014-2016), the party has lost much of its support in recent months.</p>
<p _translation="根据日报Corriere della Sera的一项调查，该国现任总理兼PD成员Paolo Gentiloni是民调中最受欢迎的个人政治家，支持率为47％。">Paolo Gentiloni, the country's current prime minister and a PD member, is the most popular individual politician in the polls, with an approval rating of 47 percent, according to&nbsp;a survey&nbsp;in the daily Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p _translation="自2014年赢得超过40％的选票以来，效绩数据稳步失去了支持。仅仅两年后，M5S在罗马和都灵的地区选举中超过了PD。&nbsp;">The PD has steadily lost support since it last won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2014. Just two years later, M5S&nbsp;surpassed PD&nbsp;in Rome and Turin in regional elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="阿尔伯塔奇解释说，支持PD的下降可归因于几个因素，其中包括Renzi 2016年失败的宪法改革公投，导致他辞职。">Albertazzi explained that the decline in support for PD can be attributed to several factors, among them Renzi's failed 2016 constitutional reform referendum that led to his resignation.</p>
<p _translation="艾伯塔奇补充说，其主要原因之一是PD已经失去了之前大部分基地的支持，因为它“没有明确的信息”。">One of the primary reasons the PD has lost the support of much of its previous base is that it "has no clear message", Albertazzi added.</p>
<p _translation="“没有人知道PD的意义，但每个人都知道贝卢斯科尼的目标。”">"No one knows what the PD stands for, but everyone knows what Berlusconi is for."</p>
<p _translation="当地媒体已经观察到，该党的主要问题似乎是缺乏潜在的联盟伙伴，可能使其无法维持其在政府中的作用。">Local media has observed that the party's primary problem appears to be the lack of potential coalition partners, likely rendering it unable to maintain its role in the government.</p>
<h2 _translation="这位喜剧演员的反建立党成了什么？">What has become of the comedian's anti-establishment party?</h2>
<p _translation="M5S平均投票率为28％，成为选举前最受欢迎的个人派对。">M5S&nbsp;was polling at an average of 28 percent, making it the most popular individual party ahead of the elections.</p>
<p _translation="这个派对由喜剧演员Beppe Grillo于2009年创立，被形容为反建立，Eurosceptic和亲环境。">Founded in 2009 by a comedian, Beppe Grillo, the party has been described as anti-establishment, Eurosceptic and pro-environment.</p>
<p _translation="M5S排除了在选举前建立联盟的潜力。">M5S ruled out the potential of creating a coalition before the elections.</p>
<p _translation="最近发现，有几名党员因未能将一半的工资捐给小企业而违反了M5S协议。">It was recently revealed that several party members had broken M5S protocol by failing to donate half of their salaries to small business.</p>

<p _translation="2017年9月被选为M5S总理后接任的领导人Luigi di Maio已承诺在国家参选之前驱逐党内“坏苹果”。">Leader Luigi di Maio, who took over in September 2017 after being voted M5S prime minister, has promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/italys-m5s-party-leader-promises-to-expel-bad-apples-before-election" target="_blank">expel</a> "bad apples" from the party before the nation takes to the ballots.</p>
<p _translation="然而，观察家们指出，丑闻在民意调查中似乎对M5S影响不大。">Yet, the scandal appeared to have little impact on M5S in the polls, observers have noted.</p>
<p _translation="尽管该党拒绝了传统政治的左右两分法，但M5S是欧洲议会自由与直接民主欧洲的成员。">Although the party has rejected the left-right dichotomy of traditional politics, M5S is a member of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy in the European Parliament.</p>
<p _translation="该组包括右翼政党，如英国的英国独立党（UKIP）和超民族主义者瑞典民主党。">That group includes right-wing parties, such as the United Kingdom's UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the ultra-nationalist Sweden Democrats.</p>
<p _translation="解释M5S采用了通常与左右相关的职位组合，并重点关注互联网接入和环境等问题，Mudde将该党形容为“非结构化的组织和领导者，他们远离实际政治”。">Explaining that M5S had adopted a combination of positions typically associated with the left and the right, along with a focus on issues like internet access and the environment, Mudde described the party as having "an amorphous structure and a leader who stays out of practical politics".</p>
<p _translation="“这使得很难找出谁为派对说话”，Mudde说。&nbsp;">This "makes it very hard to figure out who speaks for the party", Mudde said.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="他补充说：“在过去的几年中，他们越来越像是一个民粹主义激进的右派，但是，他们越来越反对移民和欧洲的观念。”">He added: "In the past years they have become more and more like a populist radical right party, however, being increasingly anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic."</p>
<p _translation="尽管M5S一直主张退出欧盟和欧元，欧元是许多成员国使用的统一欧洲货币，但其领导人最近表示，它宁愿&nbsp;暂时留在欧盟&nbsp; 。"><span>Although M5S has consistently advocated leaving the EU and the euro, the unified European currency used in many member states, its leader recently said that it&nbsp;</span>preferred to stay<span>&nbsp;in the bloc for the time being.</span></p>
<h2 _translation="预计最远的权利会有所增加吗？">Is the far right expected to gain ground?</h2>
<p _translation="CasaPound成立于2003年，将自己形容为法西斯主义者。它被指控对政治反对派和寻求庇护者实施暴力，它一贯否认这一指控。">CasaPound was established in 2003 and describes itself as fascist. It has been accused of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/anti-fascists-vow-fight-mussolini-loving-militants-180116190056142.html">carrying out violence</a> against political opponents and asylum seekers, charges it consistently denies.</p>
<p _translation="Forza Nuova成立于1997年，也赞扬法西斯统治者Benito Mussolini的遗产，并一直处于反移民组织的第一线。">Founded in 1997, Forza Nuova also hails the legacy of fascist ruler Benito Mussolini and has been on the front line of anti-migrant organising.</p>
<p _translation="双方都主张驱逐难民和移民。">Both parties advocate the expulsion of refugees and migrants.</p>
<p _translation="据分析人士称，虽然CasaPound和Forza Nuova都不会让政界人士陷入政府，但他们对国家话语的影响越来越大，特别是在移民方面。">While neither CasaPound nor Forza Nuova is likely to land politicians in the government, they have had an increasingly significant impact on the national discourse, particularly regarding migration, according to analysts.</p>

<p _translation="11月，CasaPound在罗马的奥斯蒂亚区抓住了9％的选票，引发了评论家和政治对手的担忧。">In November, CasaPound grabbed nine percent of the vote in Rome's Ostia district, sparking fears among critics and political opponents.</p>
<p _translation="“不仅仅是数量的增长，它们组织方式的可见性和有效性也有所增长，”Extreme Right，一本关于欧洲最右边的书的作者Guido Caldiron告诉Al Jazeera。">"More than a growth in numbers, there has been a growth in visibility and efficacy in the way they organise," Guido Caldiron, author of Extreme Right, a book about the far right in Europe, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p _translation="“在20世纪90年代，Forza Nuova尝试过但从未成功创建过真正的派对，但它更像是一场运动，”他解释道。">"In the 1990s, Forza Nuova tried but never succeeded to create a real party, but it was more of a movement," he explained.</p>
<p _translation="“现在[最右边]与主流政治有更紧密的联系，”他说，他认为CasaPound和Forza Nuova已经影响了联盟等更大党派的言辞。&nbsp;">"Now [the far right] has a stronger link with mainstream politics," he said, arguing that CasaPound and Forza Nuova have influenced the rhetoric of larger parties like the League.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="卡尔德隆补充说：“这一新浪潮伴随着意大利普遍权利的增长......自从90年代贝卢斯科尼时代以来，他们已经合法化，他们称自己为法西斯的事实不再是丑闻。”">Caldiron added: "This new wave goes along with the growth of the right in general in Italy … They have been legitimised since the Berlusconi era of the 90s. The fact that they call themselves fascists is no longer a scandal."</p></div></div>
