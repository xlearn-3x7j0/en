The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding [no other liquids or solids] for the first six months of life as it provides all the nutrients a baby needs. It reduces their risk of obesity in later childhood, with every month of breastfeeding associated with a four per cent decrease in risk.</p><p _translation="2.饮食均衡健康&nbsp;"><span>2. Eat a balanced and healthy diet&nbsp;</span></p><p _translation="我们都应该根据Eatwell指南的原则，以健康，多样的饮食为目标，以满足我们的能量需求。保持平衡很重要。儿童需要定时进餐和健康的零食，以获得他们所需的所有能量，作为积极的生活方式的一部分。">We should all aim to eat a healthy, varied diet based on the principles of the Eatwell guide, to meet our energy requirements. It is important to get the balance right. Children need regular meals and healthy snacks to get all the energy they need as part of an active lifestyle.</p><div>        <p _translation="母乳喂养，提供较小的膳食部分和充足的睡眠都是帮助您的孩子成为健康体重的方法（文件照片）">Breastfeeding, offering smaller meal portions and getting plenty of sleep are all methods to help your child be a healthy weight (file photo)</p></div><p _translation="3.让你的孩子保持活跃"><span>3. Keep your children active</span></p><p _translation="英国的儿童现在身体不适合过去几代人，这对他们未来的健康有影响。目前的研究表明，只有9％的男孩和10％的2至4岁女孩符合他们的活动建议。五岁以下的儿童在一天中至少应活动三小时。">Children in the UK now are less physically fit than past generations which has implications for their future health. Current studies show that only nine per cent of boys and ten per cent of girls aged two to four years of age are meeting their activity recommendations. Children under five years should be active for at least three hours spread across the day.</p><p _translation="与观看电视节目相比，年轻人花更多时间玩在线社交。统计数据显示，7至16岁的儿童每天平均在线上花费3小时，每周观看电视8小时以上可能会导致肥胖。对于孩子来说，考虑增加适合他们生活方式的活动类型并且可以在当天轻松包括这一点很重要。询问孩子们他们喜欢什么活动。鼓励他们追随自己的兴趣，开展有趣的活动。">Young people are spending more time playing and socialising online than watching television programmes. Statistics show that children aged seven to 16 spend an average of three hours a day online, and that watching TV for more than eight hours a week may be a risk for obesity. It is important for children to think about increasing the types of activities that suit their lifestyle and can be easily included in the day. Ask children what activities they enjoy. Encourage them to follow their interests and make activity fun.</p><p _translation="4.首先提供较小的部分"><span>4. Offer smaller portions at first</span></p><p _translation="儿童的胃口会有所不同，重要的是允许儿童在进食时食用食欲。从出生开始，婴儿能够调节自己的食欲和能量摄入。他们会吃适量的食物来满足他们身体的能量需求。鼓励孩子认识到饥饿的迹象和饱腹的迹象。重要的是不要教孩子们超越他们的丰满感。">The appetites of children will vary and it is important that children are allowed to eat to appetite at mealtime. From birth infants are able to regulate their own appetite and energy intake. They will eat the right amount of food to meet their body’s energy needs. Encourage children to recognise the signs of hunger and the signs of fullness. It is important not to teach children to over-ride their sense of fullness.</p><p _translation="首先提供较小的部分。如果孩子吃了一切，并要求更多，那么给予第二次帮助是可以的。请记住，第二个帮助仍应保持营养均衡。提供蔬菜，沙拉或水果的第二次帮助。鼓励孩子慢慢吃，咀嚼他们的食物，并在两口之间停下来。也许试着把刀叉放在每一口之间。">Offer smaller portions at first. It is OK to give second helpings if the child has eaten everything and is asking for more. Remember that second helpings should still be nutritionally balanced. Offer second helpings of the vegetables, salad or fruit. Encourage children to eat slowly, chew their food well and pause between mouthfuls. Perhaps try putting the knife and fork down between each mouthful.</p><p _translation="5.考虑你的家族史"><span>5. Take your family history into account</span></p><p _translation="肥胖的原因之一是家庭体重史。父母双方肥胖的风险增加19.8％，如果父母一方肥胖，风险增加8.4％。对家长来说，主动考虑家庭用餐时间非常重要。这可能是做一些家庭烹饪活动或改变一些简单的传统。不要订购披萨，取一些pitta面包，加入番茄酱和一些披萨配料。这是关于在家庭事件中围绕食物安排爱情，而不是专注于孩子，而父母在角落里吃薯片！">One of the causes of obesity is family weight history. The risk increases when both parents are obese by 19.8 per cent, and 8.4 per cent if one parent is obese. It’s important for the parent to take the initiative and think about family meal times. That might be doing some cooking activities as a family or changing some simple traditions. Instead of ordering a pizza, get some pitta bread, add tomato puree and some pizza toppings. It’s about installing a love around food as a family event, not just focusing on the child whilst the parent eats crisps in the corner!</p><p _translation="6.确保你的孩子有充足的睡眠"><span>6. Ensure your child is getting plenty of sleep</span></p><p _translation="另一个肥胖的危险因素是每晚睡眠时间少于10小时。对于一至三岁的儿童，建议每晚11-12小时。如果一个孩子的睡眠不足，他们可能会在一天中更加昏昏欲睡，这会影响他们的活动，当他们不一定饿时，他们更有可能在高能量食物中吃零食。为了帮助他们更好地睡眠，并让自己的睡眠更加充满活力，可以尝试在一天中的早些时候关闭电视机，并查看睡前例行程序，例如阅读书籍或玩家庭游戏。">Another risk factor for obesity is sleeping fewer than ten hours each night. For children aged between one and three, 11-12 hours a night is recommended. If a child isn’t getting enough sleep they’re likely to be more lethargic in the day which can impact on their activity and they will be more likely to snack on high energy foods when not necessarily hungry. To help them sleep better and wake up feeling more energised, try to turn the TV off earlier in the day and look at bedtime routines such as reading a book or playing a game as family.</p><p _translation="7.尽量不要炒你的食物"><span>7. Try not to fry your food</span></p><p _translation="烧烤，煮沸或烘烤食物，而不添加脂肪，而不是煎炸。不要忘了饮料 - 去喝低热量的饮料，如半脱脂牛奶，当然还有水。确保你避免给他们含糖饮料，如果汁饮料和南瓜。">Grill, boil or bake foods without adding fat, rather than frying. Don’t forget the drinks – go for low-calorie drinks such as semi skimmed milk and of course water. Make sure you avoid giving them sugary drinks such as juice drinks and squashes.</p><p _translation="“重要的是要认识到，在英国的一年中的某些时候，我们可能无法单独从阳光和饮食中获得足量的维生素D以防止缺乏。”Edwina说。">‘It is important to recognise that at certain times of the year in the UK, we may not obtain an adequate amount of vitamin D from sunlight and diet alone in order to prevent deficiency’, says Edwina.</p><p _translation="这篇文章最初出现，并已经与Healthista的许可转载。"><span><span>This article originally appeared on and has been reproduced with the permission of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthista.com/">Healthista</a>.</span></span></p></div></div>
