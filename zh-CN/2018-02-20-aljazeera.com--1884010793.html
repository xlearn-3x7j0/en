<p _translation="独立新闻网站Rappler周二报道说，Rodrigo Duterte直接命令他的总统安全团队禁止该组织的首席执行官和其中一名记者报道宫殿事件。&nbsp;">Independent news website Rappler reported on Tuesday that Rodrigo Duterte directly ordered his presidential security team to bar the organisation's CEO and one of its reporters from covering events at the palace.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="该报告后来被国家电视台的PTV证实。&nbsp;">The report was later confirmed by state television PTV.&nbsp;</p>

<p _translation="拉普勒说，总统在观看参议院听证会后作出了决定，在听证会上，他最信任的助手克里斯托弗·戈因在一份有问题的军事合同中的角色受到质疑。">Rappler said the president made the decision after watching a Senate hearing, in which his most trusted aide, Christopher Go, was questioned for his role in a questionable military contract.</p>
<p _translation="新闻网站首先报道了这个故事。">The story was first reported by the news website.</p>
<p _translation="Duterte的发言人Harry Roque周二表示，Rappler的记者Pia Ranada可以继续报道他的每日简报，等待法院判决新闻网站的结案。">Harry Roque, Duterte's spokesman, said on Tuesday that the Rappler reporter, Pia Ranada, can continue to cover his daily briefing pending a court decision on the news website's closure case.</p>
<p _translation="情况介绍会定期在总统府旁边的另一栋楼举行。">The briefing is regularly held in another building next to the presidential palace.</p>
<p _translation="罗克还指责拉普勒在其新闻报道中进行了“编辑”，这是该新闻媒体否认的一项指控。">Roque also accused Rappler of "editorialising" in its news reports, an allegation the news outlet has denied.</p>
<p _translation="菲律宾全国记者联盟（NUJP）在周二发表的一份声明中&nbsp; 表示， &nbsp;杜特特的“暴躁表现出他个人角色的险恶一面，对于我们这个愚蠢的国家已经不确定的民主健康和未来而言根本就不是好兆头”。"><span>In a statement on Tuesday,&nbsp;<span>the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said</span>&nbsp;Duterte's "peevishness displays a sinister side of his persona that does not bode well at all for the already uncertain health and future of democracy in our benighted country".</span></p>
<p _translation="“杜特尔特的好战不再让我们感到意外，他表现得像一个娇生惯养的小孩，”NUJP说。&nbsp;">"Duterte's belligerence no longer surprises us. He has acted much like petulant child throwing a fit," NUJP said.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="“这至少可以说是对民主的诅咒。”">"This, to say the least, is anathema to democracy."</p>
<h2 _translation="'专制领导'">'Autocratic leadership'</h2>
<p _translation="这并不是Duterte第一次与Rappler发生冲突，Rappler是2012年推出的一家新闻网站，总裁一再谴责他是“假新闻”的来源。"><span><span><span>It is not the first time that Duterte has clashed with Rappler, a news website launched in 2012 that the president has repeatedly denounced as a source of "fake news".</span></span></span></p>
<p _translation="但Rappler的编辑Marites Vitug表示，这一订单是菲律宾的又一次“挫折”，菲律宾以在东南亚地区拥有“最自由的媒体”而自豪。">But Marites Vitug, Rappler's editor at large, said the order is another "setback" to the Philippines, which prides itself on having the "freest press" in the Southeast Asia region.</p>
<p _translation="“这是一个危险的情况，表明杜特特不理解新闻在民主中的作用，”维图格在一份声明中告诉半岛电视台。">"This is a dangerous situation, showing that Duterte doesn't understand the role of the press in a democracy," Vitug told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p>
<p _translation="她说，杜特尔特“公然无视新闻界的职责”，将新闻记者视为“服从于权力的归属者”。">She said Duterte "blatantly disregards the duties of the press" by treating journalists as "subservient to the powers that be".</p>

<p _translation="“他没有制衡的概念，显示他的专制领导。”">"He has no concept of checks and balance, displaying his autocratic leadership."</p>

<p _translation="尽管杜特尔特否认在这一决定中发挥作用，但批评者表示，这是总统试图遏制异议的方式。&nbsp;"><span>While Duterte has denied playing a role in that decision, critics said it was the president's way of attempting to silence dissent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p _translation="在法庭上诉之前，拉普勒继续从首都马尼拉的总部开始运作。"><span>Pending a court appeal, Rappler continues to be in operation from its headquarters in the capital, Manila.</span></p>
<h2 _translation="暴力威胁">Threats of violence</h2>
<p _translation="当拉普勒发表一份质疑他第一任外交大臣公民身份的报告时，杜特特也感到愤怒。这位高级外交官原来是美国公民，因此被迫辞职。">Duterte was also angered when Rappler published a report questioning the citizenship of his first foreign affairs secretary. The top diplomat turned out to be a former American citizen and was forced to resign.</p>
<p _translation="新闻网站还发表了一系列报道，质疑杜特特政府对毒品的致命战争，并报道了总统涉嫌价值数百万美元的银行存款。">The news website has also published a series of reports calling into question the Duterte administration's deadly war on drugs and reported on the president's alleged multi-million dollars worth of bank deposits.</p>
