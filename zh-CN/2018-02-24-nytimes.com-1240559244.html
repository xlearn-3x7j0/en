Few people inside China, much less outside, had ever heard of Anbang. It got its start only a decade before, in the unassuming Chinese city of Ningbo. Its business: car insurance.</p><p data-para-count="314" data-total-count="826" _translation="但是，以一种非常中国的方式，安邦来自皇室。它的创始人，一个叫吴晓辉的人，还有很多早期的董事会成员，可以吹嘘他们有着令人印象深刻的家庭关系。在共产党统治政治和商业的国家，通过党的人际关系可以顺利走向成功。">But, in a very Chinese way, Anbang came from royalty. Its founder, a man named Wu Xiaohui, and many of its early board members could boast of impressive family connections. In a country where the Communist Party dominates politics and business, personal connections through the party can smooth the way to success.</p><p data-para-count="246" data-total-count="1072" _translation="星期五它的连接与否都崩溃了。中国政府扣押了安邦，称它违反了规定，并损害了它的支付能力。其前主席吴晓辉现在在上海法院受到刑事指控。">Connections or not, on Friday it all came crashing down. The Chinese government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/business/china-anbang-waldorf-astoria.html">seized</a> Anbang, saying it broke regulations and jeopardized its ability to pay claims.

But he had married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, once China’s top leader and one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history.
