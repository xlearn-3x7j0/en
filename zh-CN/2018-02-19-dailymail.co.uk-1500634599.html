<div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Ten minutes into the second half at Huddersfield, BT's pundits were criticising <a href="undefined/sport/alexis_sanchez/index.html" id="mol-56aac8a0-14fb-11e8-ba14-cb6f7fece196">Alexis Sanchez</a> for failing to provide defensive cover down <a href="undefined/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html" id="mol-56aa5370-14fb-11e8-ba14-cb6f7fece196">Manchester United</a>'s left side. Seconds later, Sanchez was creating a decisive second goal for his team, finished off nicely by <a href="undefined/sport/romelu-lukaku/index.html" id="mol-56abb300-14fb-11e8-ba14-cb6f7fece196">Romelu Lukaku</a>.</p><p>To me this sums up this current United side. They can look terribly ordinary and lacking in spark but at the same time they are, on the whole, reasonably and predictably effective.</p><p><a href="undefined/sport/jose_mourinho/index.html" id="mol-56ab3dd0-14fb-11e8-ba14-cb6f7fece196">Jose Mourinho</a>'s team are currently lying second in the Premier League, are in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup — with a kind draw at home to Brighton — and the last 16 of the Champions League. Mourinho, it seems, is doing something right, at least.</p><div><p>Jose Mourinho's Manchester United side are a strange one to watch nowadays</p></div><p>Yet this is, I must say, one of the strangest United teams I have ever seen. They are short on dominating characters and players who can run a game of football. They are short of personality and short of a bit of arrogance. But they do find a way to get results.</p><p>It was strange to watch a United team dominated in possession and territory by Huddersfield, but at the same time there was never any doubt in my mind that they would win the game.</p><div>        <p>They lack arrogance and the dominant characters that can run and win games for them</p></div><p>United will not be Premier League champions this season and I do not think they will finish second if Liverpool continue to improve. But they go to Sevilla in the Champions League this week and I think Europe may hold something for them this time round.</p><p>Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham have scored 11 away goals between them in their knockout ties. I would not expect Mourinho's men to add greatly to that tally.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is a United team that can be effective in their own puzzling, prosaic, resolute way. In the Champions League, that can get you a long way.</p><div>        <p>They will struggle to finish second but have the tools to thrive in the Champions League</p></div></div>
