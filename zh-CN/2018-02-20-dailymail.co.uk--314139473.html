<p _translation="伦敦2月19日电---切尔西队主教练安东尼奥孔特表示，面对巴塞罗那在欧冠16强赛中的前景，他为周二的冲突做好了准备。">LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said the prospect of facing Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 has given him sleepless nights as he prepares for Tuesday's clash.</p>
<p _translation="周五意大利队在周五的足总杯第五轮比赛中以4比0力挫二线赫尔城队，为首回合的比赛做好准备，但他的头脑很快转向了巴萨。">The Italian's side warmed up for the first leg tie by thrashing struggling second-tier Hull City 4-0 in the FA Cup fifth round on Friday but his mind quickly turned to Barca.</p>
<p _translation="“在足总杯比赛之后，睡觉有点困难，因为当你需要玩这种类型的比赛时，你必须准备好所有的事情：大事情和细节，”孔蒂说，他一直在安装这个季节的压力。">"After the FA Cup game, it was a bit difficult to sleep well, because when you have to play this type of game, you have to prepare everything: the big things, and the details," said Conte, who has been under mounting pressure this season.</p>
<p _translation="“我们有一个想法，我们有一个计划在我们的脑海中，在这个特定的时刻对我们来说，选择最好的球员是非常重要的，然后在比赛中尽力做到最好。”他告诉一则新闻星期一会议。">"We have an idea; we have a plan in our heads. In this specific moment for us it's very important to pick the players that are in the best form, and then try to do our best during the game, "he told a news conference on Monday.</p>
<p _translation="2012年切尔西在加入欧洲冠军联赛冠军的路上击败了加泰罗尼亚队，但是孔蒂承认自己是进入周二令人垂涎欲滴的比赛的弱者。">Chelsea last defeated the Catalan side in 2012 on the way to their only Champions League title but Conte admits they are the underdogs going into Tuesday's mouthwatering match.</p>
<p _translation="“我们正在谈论一场巨大的比赛，对我们来说是一个巨大的挑战，”康特上个赛季表现出英超联赛冠军，但他的第四个赛季在第二个赛季中一直努力达到如此高的标准。">"We are talking about a massive game, and a big challenge for us," said Conte who delivered the Premier League title last term but whose fourth-placed side have struggled to reach such high standards during his second season in charge.</p>
<p _translation="“我们必须与世界上最好的球队之一进行对抗，”他补充道。“我们必须很高兴才能玩这种类型的比赛，这并不容易，我们必须高度重视，但同时我们必须有雄心去尝试踢足球。">"We have to play against a fantastic team, one of the best in the world," he added. "We must be excited to play this type of game. It won't be easy. We must pay great attention, but at the same time we must have ambition to try to play our football.</p>
<p _translation="“我们已经为这场比赛做好准备了，当然，我们开始时是处于劣势，因此，我们一定很高兴能够迎接这个挑战。”">"We have worked and prepared well for this game. We start as underdogs, for sure. For this reason, we must be excited to have this challenge."</p>
<p _translation="意大利人警告说，他的球员必须准备好迎接巴塞罗那队，他们是西甲联赛失控的领导人，并且还将参加西班牙杯决赛。">The Italian warned that his players must be prepared to suffer to get past a Barcelona side who are runaway leaders in La Liga and are also through to the Spanish Cup final.</p>
<p _translation="“我们非常了解巴塞罗那的特点，”Conte补充道。">"We know the characteristics of Barcelona very well," added Conte.</p>
<p _translation="“他们喜欢拥有球，他们喜欢主宰，在每场比赛中他们都能创造出很多机会。">"They like to have possession of the ball; they like to dominate. In every game they are able to create many chances.</p>
