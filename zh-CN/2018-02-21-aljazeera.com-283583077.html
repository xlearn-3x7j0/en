<p _translation="这是一个有风的星期六早上，七岁的父亲穿着一件褪色的海军航海外套，印上黄色的纱笼，走在他温和的家门外的牲畜中间。">It's a windy Saturday morning and the father of seven, dressed in a faded, navy track jacket and printed yellow sarong, is walking amid the livestock outside his modest home.</p>
<p _translation="Njapaa向他的一个孙子们大声呼喊，他们整天围绕着距离肯尼亚首都内罗毕约250公里的一个小村庄Doldol牧羊。">Njapaa shouts to one of his grandchildren, who herds goats and sheep all day around Doldol, a small village about 250km from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</p>
<p _translation="“准备好放牧这些山羊和羊，确保你准时带回来！” 他看到他的孙子在四处闲逛时大叫。通常，牲畜会早早离开。">"Prepare yourself to herd these goats and sheep! Make sure you bring them back on time!" he shouts upon seeing his grandson was lazing around. Normally, the livestock would have left early.</p>
<p _translation="尽管每天都有他的日常生活，但Njapaa是一个非常苦恼的人。">Despite going about his daily routine, Njapaa is a deeply distressed man.</p>
<p _translation="78岁的肯尼亚大裂谷Yaaku部落的一名成员&nbsp;是仍然可以说该团体母语Yakunte的七人之一。所有剩余的Yakunte演讲者都超过70岁。&nbsp;"><span>A member of the Yaaku tribe of Kenya's Rift Valley,&nbsp;</span>the 78-year-old&nbsp;is one of seven people who can still speak the group's native language, Yakunte. All the remaining Yakunte speakers are over the age of 70.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p _translation="“看到那些应该从我们手中接管的年轻人已经决定放弃这种美丽的语言令人不安，”Njapaa说，咀嚼khat，一种开花植物和许多东非洲人咀嚼的温和麻醉剂。">"It's disturbing to see that young people who are supposed to take over from us have decided to abandon this beautiful language," said Njapaa, chewing khat, a flowering plant and mild narcotic chewed by many East Africans.</p>
<p _translation="“我们要去哪里？”">"Where are we heading?"</p>
<h2 _translation="同化历史">History of assimilation</h2>
<p _translation="在一个多世纪以前，这个名字代表了狩猎人，从埃塞俄比亚迁徙到肯尼亚裂谷的穆科戈多森林的山洞和丘陵。">The Yaaku, a name which translates to the hunting people, migrated from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html">Ethiopia</a> to the caves and hills of the Mukogodo forest in Kenya's Rift Valley more than a century ago.</p>
<p _translation="在那里，他们开始狩猎并养蜂; 蜂蜜是他们饮食中的主食。">There, they began to hunt and keep bees; honey is the staple food in their diet.</p>
<p _translation="上个世纪初，肯尼亚武士部落和东非最大的牧民社区之一的马赛人在白人定居者占领他们的土地之后寻找定居的地方。">At the beginning of the last century, the Maasai, a Kenyan warrior tribe and one of the largest pastoral communities in East Africa, were looking for places to settle after white settlers took their land.</p>
<p _translation="他们选择在穆科果多森林中重新安置，并与他们开始交易的雅库一起生活。">They chose to resettle in the Mukogodo forest and lived alongside the Yaaku, with whom they began trading.</p>
<p _translation="但由于雅库的人口少，财富少，马赛人认为他们的新邻居不如他们，称他们为“无牲口的穷人”。">But due to the Yaaku's small population and lesser wealth, the Maasai saw their new neighbours as inferior, calling them Ntorobo, meaning "poor people with no livestock".</p>
<p _translation="老人Njapaa说，他出生时在他的村庄里有大约20个Yaaku人。&nbsp;">Njapaa, the old man, said there were about 20 Yaaku people in his village when he was born.&nbsp;</p>
<p _translation="雅库开始融入马赛社区，并随后采用马赛语所用的马语&nbsp;来缓解交流。">The Yaaku began assimilating into the Maasai community and subsequently adopted the Maa language spoken by the Maasai<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to ease communication.</p>
<p _translation="“那是当我们的语言开始慢慢减少时，”Njapaa说。">"That's when our language started dwindling slowly," Njapaa said.</p>
<p _translation="今天在肯尼亚仅有约4000人参加活动，雅库被肯尼亚政府视为马赛人的一个小分队。">Numbering only about 4,000 people in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html">Kenya</a> today, the Yaaku are considered a sub-clan of the Maasai by the Kenyan government.</p>
<p _translation="Njapaa说，自从他们是小孩以来，他试图教他的孩子Yakunte，但无济于事。今天，他们都使用马赛语。">Njapaa said he tried to teach his children Yakunte since they were kids, but to no avail. Today, all of them use the Maasai language.</p>
<p _translation="在年轻一代Yaaku中，这种情况很普遍，他们很少对学习一种几乎不会说话的语言感兴趣，现年34岁的Ngaine Kitarpei说，&nbsp; 他自愿努力挽救社区的语言和文化。">That is a common thing among younger generations of Yaaku, who are largely uninterested in learning a language that so few can speak, said Ngaine Kitarpei, 34,&nbsp;<span>who has volunteered in efforts to save the community's language and culture.</span></p>
<p _translation="“许多年轻的雅库男人和女人问我们，谁会[我们]说话？对他们来说，马赛语言很容易，他们每天与他沟通，”Kitarpei，三个父亲谁不能建立一个句子在Yakunte，告诉铝半岛电视台。"><span>"Many young Yaaku men and women ask us, who would [we] speak to? To them, Maasai language is easy and they communicate with it daily," Kitarpei, a father of three who cannot construct a single sentence in Yakunte, told Al Jazeera.</span></p>
<h2 _translation="恢复Yakunte？">Reviving Yakunte?</h2>
<p _translation="联合国教科文组织估计，世界上三分之一的语言来自撒哈拉以南非洲地区。">One-third of the world's languages come from sub-Saharan Africa, UN world heritage group UNESCO estimates.</p>
<p _translation="该组织表示，在接下来的100年内，非洲国家所讲的2,000多种语言中有多达10％可能会消失。">The organisation says as much as 10 percent of the over 2,000 languages spoken in the African countries may disappear within the next 100 years.</p>
<p _translation="2010年，教科文组织发布了世界语言面临危险的报告。雅库是被列为灭绝的6种肯尼亚语言之一。其他人是Elmolo，Kinare，Kore，Lorkoti和Sogoo。">In 2010, UNESCO released a <a href="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap" target="_blank">report</a> of the world languages in danger. Yaaku is among 6 Kenyan languages listed as extinct. The others are Elmolo, Kinare, Kore, Lorkoti and Sogoo.</p>
<p _translation="当地企图重振语言的努力已经挣扎起来。">Local attempts to revive the language have struggled to get off the ground.</p>
<p _translation="Manasseh Doldol的52岁的牧师Ole Matunge试图说服村里的年轻人在长老还活着的时候学习Yakunte。">Manasseh Ole Matunge, a 52-year-old priest in Doldol, has tried to convince young people in the village to learn Yakunte while the elders are still alive.</p>
<p _translation="“如果这些老年人死亡，那将是这种语言的结束，” 马丁说&nbsp; ，他是五岁的父亲，她的祖母是村里只有两位在 2010年去世前流利地说这种语言的妇女之一&nbsp;。">"If these old men die, that would be the end of this language," said&nbsp;<span>Matunge, a father of five whose grandmother was one of only two women in the village who spoke the language fluently before her death in&nbsp;</span>2010.</p>
<p _translation="Matunge说：“我们这一代和未来的人会活着知道曾经有一种叫Yakunte的语言。">"Our generation and future ones will live to know that once upon a time there was a language called Yakunte," Matunge said.</p>
<p _translation="2010年，他创办了一个文化团体，将年轻人和少数流利的Yakunte演讲者带到一起，并出版了一本Yakunte翻译成斯瓦希里语和马赛语的小词典。">In 2010, he started a cultural group to bring young people and the few fluent Yakunte speakers that are left together and published a small dictionary of Yakunte words and phrases translated into Kiswahili and Maasai.</p>
<p _translation="但是他的努力很少出现。">But little has come out of his efforts.</p>
<p _translation="“在这一点上，我们已经做了一切，” Matunge告诉半岛电视台。">"At this point, we have done everything," <span>Matunge told Al Jazeera</span>.</p>
<p _translation="“我认为现在是我们接受我们的语言已经死亡并继续说出我们邻居的语言的时候了。”">"I think it's high time we accept that our language is dead and continue speaking our neighbour's language."</p>
<p _translation="Maarten Mous是荷兰莱顿大学的非洲语言学教授，他对雅库人进行了广泛的研究，他说社区不可能以原始形式恢复垂死的语言。">Maarten Mous, a professor of African linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has extensively studied the Yaaku people, said it is impossible for the community to revive the dying language in its original form.</p>
<p _translation="他说，一个更现实的目标是将Yakunte的词汇加入更广泛使用的Maasai语言中。">A more realistic goal, he said, would be to incorporate Yakunte words into the more widely used Maasai language.</p>
<p _translation="“继续说马赛语，但重新塑造一些话语，带入你被吞噬语言的旧念，”Mous建议道。">"Continue to speak Maasai but reshape some of the words; bring in your old remembered words from the swallowed language," Mous advised.</p>
<p _translation="然而，随着世界在2月21日观看国际母语日，庆祝多语言和语言权利的年度活动，Yakunte演讲者如Njapaa已经失去了希望。">However, as the world observes International Mother Language Day on February 21, an annual event that celebrates multilingualism and language rights,&nbsp;Yakunte speakers like Njapaa have lost hope.</p>
<p _translation="“我的祖先必须对我们感到失望，”他说。">"My ancestors must be disappointed in us," he said.</p>
<p _translation="“我们根本没有保护我们的语言，我们选择说我们的邻居，并忘记了我们的。”">"We did not protect our language at all. We chose to speak that of our neighbours and forgot ours."</p>
