<p data-para-count="53" data-total-count="53" _translation="波兰克拉科夫 - “我还应该去波兰吗？”">KRAKOW, Poland — “Should I still visit Poland?”</p><p data-para-count="439" data-total-count="492" _translation="在过去的两周里，我曾计划前往克拉科夫的旅行者问过这个问题，我在纽约长大后住了17年，然后在以色列度过了七年。他们担心波兰政府最近通过的“ 大屠杀法案 ”以及在国际外交层面以及波兰公众和全球犹太社区中爆发的口水战。">I’ve been asked this question a lot in the last two weeks by people planning trips to Krakow, where I’ve lived for 17 years after growing up in New York and then spending seven years in Israel. They are worried about the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/europe/poland-death-camp-law.html">Holocaust bill</a>” recently passed by the Polish government and the war of words that erupted in response on the international diplomatic level, as well as among the Polish public and the global Jewish community.</p><p data-para-count="427" data-total-count="919" _translation="这种担忧是真诚的，保证和赞赏的。我们这个波兰的犹太社区正在经历着充满挑战的时代。这些我们称之为家的国家现在可能会觉得不太欢迎。一方面，刚刚发现自己犹太人根源的年轻人热切地加入了在华沙和克拉科夫新开设的希勒尔学生组织。但他们认为未来会带来什么问题。">The concern is genuine, warranted and appreciated. We, the Polish Jewish community, are weathering challenging times. The country we call home can feel a little less welcoming these days. On one hand, young people who only recently discovered their Jewish roots have eagerly joined newly opened Hillel student organizations in Warsaw and Krakow. But they hold in the back of their minds a question of what the future may bring.</p><p data-para-count="452" data-total-count="1371" _translation="波兰犹太领导人也正在努力应对一个不确定的未来，因为我们继续在一个从民主转向民粹主义的环境中建立犹太人生活。这种转变对于犹太人或自由开放社会中的任何人都不是好兆头。现在大屠杀法案将波兰民族在大屠杀中的任何责任定为刑事犯罪，这可能会使我们与我们非犹太人邻国的良好关系复杂化。">Polish Jewish leaders, too, are grappling with an uncertain future as we continue to build Jewish life in an environment that has taken a turn away from democracy toward populism. That shift is never a good sign for Jews — or anyone in a free and open society. And now the Holocaust bill, which criminalizes statements that the Polish nation had any responsibility in the Holocaust, may complicate our good relationship with our non-Jewish neighbors.</p><p data-para-count="501" data-total-count="1872" _translation="在过去的30年里，在这些邻居的帮助下我们设法重建的是真实的。这是强大的，它不仅来自政府的政策，而且来自基层的努力。我们通过与非犹太高中学生，老年人和许多其他人共同建造犹太教学校，犹太教堂，社区中心和博物馆。他们不仅允许这些机构出生和繁荣，而且还有许多人站出来参与犹太人的重生。">What we have managed to rebuild over the last 30 years with the help of those neighbors is real. It is strong and it has emerged not only from government policy, but also from grass-roots efforts. We’ve built Jewish schools, synagogues, community centers and museums by working hand in hand with non-Jewish high school students, senior citizens and many others. Not only have they allowed these institutions to be born and flourish, but many have stood up and taken an active part in Jewish rebirth.</p>
<p data-para-count="413" data-total-count="2285" id="story-continues-1" _translation="在希特勒和斯大林的军队于1939年入侵波兰之前，这里有350万犹太人。战争和大屠杀数量减少到35万人以下。在1945年至1989年的共产党时期，这个数字一直在减少，当时犹太人感到不受欢迎，甚至被迫移民。在战后的几年中，还有约185,000人离开; 在五十年代后期又有五万人，1968年则有一万八千人。">Before Hitler’s and Stalin’s forces invaded Poland in 1939, it was home to 3.5 million Jews. The war and Holocaust reduced that number to 350,000 or less. The number kept shrinking during the Communist period from 1945 to 1989, when Jews were made to feel unwelcome and even forced to emigrate. In the immediate postwar years, about 185,000 left; another 50,000 did in the late 1950s, and some 18,000 in 1968.</p>

<p data-para-count="680" data-total-count="2965" _translation="在那些黑暗的日子里，波兰对西方是封闭的，这阻止了几乎所有的准游客旅行和支持犹太社区。波兰犹太人感到孤独，孤立于犹太人的世界，因为他们做出了是留下还是去的痛苦决定。那些经常留下来的人隐藏了他们的犹太身份，甚至是从他们自己的孩子身上，为了解决问题。当共产主义垮台时，没有多少移民或他们的后代回来。这两个因素使得很难判断在波兰有多少犹太人留下来，但这可能在数万人之中; 有些是幸存者的子孙，最近才知道他们有犹太人的根。">During those dark days, Poland was closed to the West, which prevented nearly all prospective visitors from traveling and supporting the Jewish community. Polish Jews felt alone, isolated from the Jewish world as they made the painful decision of whether to stay or go. Those who stayed frequently hid their Jewish identities, even from their own children, in order to get by. And when Communism fell, not many émigrés or their descendants returned. Those two factors have left it hard to gauge how many Jews remain in Poland, but it is probably in the low tens of thousands; some are children and grandchildren of survivors and only recently learned that they had Jewish roots.</p>        <a href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

We aren’t sealed off from visitors. In the past couple of decades, our Jewish community has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors who have come to Poland to see the Nazi death camps, the shtetls where Jewish villagers once lived and the graves of great rabbis.</p><p data-para-count="317" data-total-count="3598" _translation="他们也发现了一些意想不到的事情：犹太生活重新出现。犹太人和非犹太人之间合作的奇迹，相信通过共同努力，我们可以确保波兰拥有光明的犹太人未来。在此之后的17年中，我始终坚信这种合作将会持续下去。">They also have found something unexpected: Jewish life emerging anew. Nothing less than a miracle of cooperation between Jews and non-Jews who believe that by working together we can ensure that Poland has a bright Jewish future. And after 17 years here, I remain solidly optimistic that this cooperation will endure.</p><p data-para-count="507" data-total-count="4105" _translation="那些与我们社区有过接触的游客已经教会了我们并且被我们教过。他们在遇到想要进入犹太教机构并重新与他们的遗产重新联系的年轻波兰犹太人之后，已经离开了人们。通过这次接触，波兰犹太人开始明白，他们不再孤单。他们不仅是一个更加接受的波兰的一部分，而且也是一个大的，混乱的，复杂的和相互关联的犹太人世界的一部分，这个世界已经开放的双臂欢迎波兰犹太人回到自己的位置。">Those visitors who have engaged with our communities have taught us and been taught by us. They have left invigorated after meeting young Polish Jews who are eager to enter Jewish institutions and reconnect to their heritage. And through this engagement, Polish Jews have come to understand that they are no longer alone. They are part of not only a more accepting Poland, but also of a big, messy, complex and interconnected Jewish world that has welcomed Polish Jews back into its own fold with open arms.</p><p data-para-count="322" data-total-count="4427" _translation="所以答案是：是的，来参观波兰。走在我无畏地走过的历史悠久的街道上，作为一个骄傲的犹太人。看到难民营之外。超越历史，既有美丽又有悲剧。与一个经历过如此多痛苦的社区站在一起，但却乐观和渴望重新加入犹太人的世界。">So the answer is: Yes, come visit Poland. Walk down the historic streets that I walk without fear as a proud Jew. See beyond the camps. Go beyond the history, both the beautiful and the tragic. Stand with a community that has been through so much suffering, yet has emerged optimistic and eager to rejoin the Jewish world.</p><p data-para-count="172" data-total-count="4599" _translation="您的访问不会默认接受错误的法律。这将加强他们国家和更广泛的国家全面接受波兰犹太人的努力。">Your visit would not represent tacit acceptance of a misguided law. It would reinforce efforts for full acceptance of Poland’s Jews by their country and the larger world.</p><p data-para-count="38" data-total-count="4637" _translation="今天我们需要更多的朋友，而不是更少。">Today we need more friends, not fewer.</p>
